Einstein could be described by a rotation of the set of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2324">AXES</a>. We are<br>
all accustomed to a rotation of our ordinary cartesian set of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2325">AXES</a><br>
describing the position of a point. We ordinarily choose our <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2326">AXES</a> at<br>
we change our <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2329">AXES</a>; they are always orthogonal, but in moving from<br>

an observer on Arcturus used a similar set of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2334">AXES</a> and the method of<br>

we are not limited to the particular set of four orthogonal <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2409">AXES</a><br>

of reference <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2419">AXES</a>; therefore the mathematical expression of our laws<br>

of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2425">AXES</a> of reference, i.e., of a mathematical transformation. To a<br>
an airplane. This means that whereas with reference to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2429">AXES</a> fixed<br>

a case where by the transfer of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2489">AXES</a> from the earth itself to the<br>

g's, because by the transfer of our <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2540">AXES</a> from the Galilean type<br>
their values can not depend upon the use of any special <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2544">AXES</a>; the<br>

not move unless something causes it to move; to make the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_528">BODY</a> move<br>
you must overcome the inertia of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_529">BODY</a>. On the other hand, if a<br>

is the relative motion of one <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1366">BODY</a> with respect to another. This<br>
simply another way of saying that what is a certain time on one <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1402">BODY</a><br>

origin. In particular what <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2380">CAN</a> be done with respect to gravitational<br>
adopted by Minkowski. We <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2410">CAN</a> choose any set of four-dimensional<br>
as a deformation of space. Thus I <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2440">CAN</a> draw a line on a sheet of paper<br>
or of rubber and by bending and stretching the sheet, I <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2441">CAN</a> make the<br>
intersections of such lines. By analogy I <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2447">CAN</a> draw in ordinary space<br>
a great number of intersecting lines on a sheet of rubber; I <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2448">CAN</a><br>
Now, at last we come to gravitation. We <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2461">CAN</a> not imagine any world-line<br>
Granting, then, the principle of equivalence, we <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2515">CAN</a> so choose axes at<br>
their values <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2544">CAN</a> not depend upon the use of any special axes; the<br>
which must be so near the truth that we <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2553">CAN</a> properly call it at least<br>
certainly am not one of the ten. But I <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2582">CAN</a> also say that, after a<br>
is nothing in them which I <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2584">CAN</a> not understand, given the time to become<br>

that we <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2697">CAN</a> be justified in our belief. We can not imagine any way<br>
that we can be justified in our belief. We <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2697">CAN</a> not imagine any way<br>
by which we <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2698">CAN</a> become conscious of the translation of the earth in<br>
space; but by means of gyroscopes we <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2699">CAN</a> learn a great deal about its<br>

this are most interesting, but no decision <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2710">CAN</a> as yet be made as to<br>
the justification of the hypothesis. In any case we <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2711">CAN</a> say that<br>

<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_204">DISTANCE</a> that separates them. This is the concentrated form of<br>
depend upon the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_208">DISTANCE</a> between these two bodies. Newton showed<br>
that if the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_209">DISTANCE</a> between the sun and the earth were doubled the<br>
on the other hand, the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_212">DISTANCE</a> were halved, the attractive power<br>

inversely as the square of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_374">DISTANCE</a>. Making use of this hypothesis,<br>
of gravity varies inversely as the square of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_383">DISTANCE</a> had now<br>

well reverse our ideas of time and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1226">DISTANCE</a>. The time it takes to go<br>

since each letter will have a greater <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1411">DISTANCE</a> to travel than its<br>
clock ticking, you would find that as your <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1413">DISTANCE</a> from home keeps<br>
intimately associated with our method of measuring space, the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1436">DISTANCE</a><br>
and the greatest <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1794">DISTANCE</a> which sound is ever known to have traveled<br>
because it postulated "action at a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1803">DISTANCE</a>,"--for example, the<br>
a displacement varying inversely as the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2741">DISTANCE</a> of the ray from<br>

The <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1066">DISTANCES</a> between bodies in the solar system is so immense that,<br>
Immense as these <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1081">DISTANCES</a> are, they are small as compared to the<br>

The idea of "continuity" implies <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1813">DISTANCES</a> between adjacent points<br>

that the revolution of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_292">EARTH</a> around the sun takes the form of an<br>

attraction possessed by the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_319">EARTH</a>, to which the name "gravity" had been<br>

The nearest body in space to the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_335">EARTH</a> is the moon, some 240,000 miles<br>
away. Would an apple reach the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_336">EARTH</a> if thrown from the moon? But<br>

Newton reasoned that what keeps the moon revolving around the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_369">EARTH</a> is<br>
Newton calculated what the attractive power possessed by the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_375">EARTH</a> must<br>
this force with the force exerted by the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_377">EARTH</a> in pulling the apple<br>

pull? that, in fact, not only the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_389">EARTH</a>'s motion, but the motion of<br>

the earth attracting the moon, and the moon the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_409">EARTH</a>, what we really<br>
mean is that every one of the myriad particles composing the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_410">EARTH</a><br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_418">EARTH</a> or the moon, the entire mass might be considered as residing<br>

mass of fire, much bigger than our own <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1054">EARTH</a>, and very, very far<br>
away. The sun has its family of eight planets--of which the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1055">EARTH</a> is<br>

in 4 days. If you could continue your journey around the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1071">EARTH</a> at<br>
the 35 days it would take you to circumscribe the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1076">EARTH</a>. If instead<br>
the universe--our solar system. We have seen that the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1089">EARTH</a> travels<br>
around the sun, and the moon around the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1090">EARTH</a>. At some time in the<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1092">EARTH</a> and the sun. Then we get the eclipse of the sun. As the moon<br>
is smaller than the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1093">EARTH</a>, only a portion of the earth's surface<br>
is smaller than the earth, only a portion of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1093">EARTH</a>'s surface<br>
on the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1125">EARTH</a> the star will have appeared to shift from A to A'.<br>
Let us take another illustration. Every time the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1231">EARTH</a> turns on its<br>

THE <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_712">ETHER</a> AND ITS CONSEQUENCES<br>
is left out of consideration. This medium we call the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_717">ETHER</a>. [2]<br>
of being a rope is the medium called the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_744">ETHER</a>.<br>
the medium is the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_754">ETHER</a>.<br>
What Is This "<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_756">ETHER</a>"? Balloonists find conditions more and more<br>
beyond? Nothing but the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_761">ETHER</a>, it is claimed. Light from the sun and<br>
stars reaches us via the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_762">ETHER</a>.<br>
But what is this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_764">ETHER</a>? We cannot handle it. We cannot see it. It<br>
which waves were propagated through this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_771">ETHER</a>. If, as the wave<br>
theory teaches us, the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_772">ETHER</a> can be set in motion, then according<br>
to laws of mechanics, the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_773">ETHER</a> has mass. If so it is smaller in<br>
this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_776">ETHER</a> has any mass, why does it offer no detectable resistance<br>
Lodge, in arguing in favor of an <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_781">ETHER</a>, holds that its presence cannot<br>
all sides;--all of which tells us nothing about the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_785">ETHER</a>, but does<br>
Waves Set up in This <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_791">ETHER</a>. The waves are not all of the same<br>
that space is pervaded by <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_808">ETHER</a> was given when Maxwell discovered<br>
same medium as light, namely, the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_818">ETHER</a>.<br>
being due to the passage of electric waves through the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_822">ETHER</a>. This<br>
the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_831">ETHER</a>, comparable, in so far as velocity is concerned, to light<br>
can act. To this medium the name "<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_946">ETHER</a>" was given. However, all<br>
attempts to show the presence of such an <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_947">ETHER</a> failed. Naturally<br>
enough, some began to doubt the existence of an <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_948">ETHER</a> altogether.<br>
is the r√¥le of alcohol in causing water and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1028">ETHER</a> (the an√¶sthetic)<br>
to mix. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1029">ETHER</a> and water will mix no better than oil and water, without<br>
the "<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1142">ETHER</a>" of space (the wave theory of light), and where weight is<br>
all-pervading "<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1266">ETHER</a>" in space. Light sets up wave disturbances in<br>
this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1267">ETHER</a>, and is thus propagated. If the ocean were the ether, the<br>
this ether, and is thus propagated. If the ocean were the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1267">ETHER</a>, the<br>
waves of the ocean would compare with the waves set up by the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1268">ETHER</a>.<br>
But what is this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1270">ETHER</a>? It cannot be seen. It defies weight. It<br>
this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1272">ETHER</a>. To the layman this sounds very much like another name<br>
To us, of importance is the conception that this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1276">ETHER</a> is absolutely<br>
then the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1279">ETHER</a> is the long-sought-for point of reference, the guide<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1283">ETHER</a>, and a stationary ether, and if the earth moves with reference to<br>
ether, and a stationary <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1283">ETHER</a>, and if the earth moves with reference to<br>
this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1284">ETHER</a>, the earth, in moving, must set up ether "currents"--just<br>
this ether, the earth, in moving, must set up <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1284">ETHER</a> "currents"--just<br>
Our river is the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1295">ETHER</a>. The earth, if moving in this ether, will<br>
Our river is the ether. The earth, if moving in this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1295">ETHER</a>, will<br>
set up an <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1296">ETHER</a> stream, the up stream being parallel to the earth's<br>
this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1298">ETHER</a> stream and back, and note the time; and then turn the<br>
But this was contrary to all reason if the postulate of an <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1308">ETHER</a> was<br>
sound. Must we then revise our ideas of an <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1309">ETHER</a>? Perhaps after all<br>
there is no <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1310">ETHER</a>.<br>
But if no <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1312">ETHER</a>, how are we to explain the propagation of light in<br>
of its motion through the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1318">ETHER</a> current. To say that bodies are<br>
wh<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1343">ETHER</a> there is an ether, and if so, what is the velocity of the earth<br>
in reference to this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1344">ETHER</a>? Lorentz maintains that there is an ether,<br>
in reference to this ether? Lorentz maintains that there is an <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1344">ETHER</a>,<br>
that there is no possible way of identifying this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1351">ETHER</a>. Suppose we<br>
ignore the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1352">ETHER</a> altogether, what then? [9]<br>
If we do ignore the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1354">ETHER</a> we no longer have any absolute point of<br>
reference; for if the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1355">ETHER</a> is considered stationary the velocity of<br>
all bodies within the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1356">ETHER</a> may be referred to it; any point in space<br>
may be considered a fixed point. If, however, there is no <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1357">ETHER</a>, or if<br>
all-pervading <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1369">ETHER</a>.<br>
of reference, if the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1382">ETHER</a> does not exist or does not function, if<br>
in physical laws led to the supposition of an "<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1805">ETHER</a>." We may here<br>
the "<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1808">ETHER</a>" theory. "In the formulation of physical laws, only those<br>
capable of being actually observed." And the "<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1810">ETHER</a>" has not been<br>
"<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1818">ETHER</a>" as an absolute base of reference--leads to the principle of<br>
reality of this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1826">ETHER</a> rather than in that of matter. Witness the<br>
"To my mind the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1829">ETHER</a> of space is a substantial reality with<br>
space, as we call it, is full of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1833">ETHER</a>, but it makes no appeal to<br>
is a modification of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1836">ETHER</a>, a very porous substance, a thing more<br>
unsubstantial, as compared to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1838">ETHER</a>."<br>
"The properties of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1842">ETHER</a> seem to be perfect. Matter is less so; it has<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1844">ETHER</a> space. It doesn't wear out; there is no dissipation of energy;<br>
there is no friction. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1845">ETHER</a> is material, yet it is not matter; both<br>
are substantial realities in physics, but it is the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1846">ETHER</a> of space<br>
there is no getting hold of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1850">ETHER</a> except indirectly."<br>
"I consider the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1852">ETHER</a> of space," says Lodge, in conclusion, "the one<br>

Newton's laws of motion are really axioms, like the axioms of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_513">EUCLID</a>:<br>
that the axioms of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_515">EUCLID</a> seem more obviously true. For example,<br>
when <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_516">EUCLID</a> informs us that "things which are equal to the same<br>

then, non-<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2601">EUCLIDEAN</a>. There is no way by which this deduction can be<br>
a fine account of non-<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2927">EUCLIDEAN</a> geometry.<br>
was expected, because it contradicted <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2138">EUCLIDIAN</a> geometry. In other<br>

and hence its <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_405">GRAVITATIONAL</a> pull is stronger. The same is true of<br>

<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_535">GRAVITY</a> acts on it and tends to pull it downwards.<br>

of a rod when it is moving in the direction of its own <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2219">LENGTH</a> with<br>
a uniform velocity, that is, after having adopted a scale of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2220">LENGTH</a>,<br>
two ways of assigning a number to the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2221">LENGTH</a> of the rod concerned. One<br>

of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_490">LIGHT</a>."<br>
Newton's Researches on <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_572">LIGHT</a>. In 1665, when but 23 years old,<br>
the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_583">LIGHT</a> from the sun, which appears white to us, is in reality a<br>
a prism between the ray of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_585">LIGHT</a> and a screen. A spectrum showing<br>
to the nature of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_596">LIGHT</a>.<br>
That the nature of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_598">LIGHT</a> should have been a subject for speculation<br>
reach. In astronomy, therefore, a study of the properties of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_604">LIGHT</a><br>
But what is this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_607">LIGHT</a>? We open our eyes and we see; we close our eyes<br>
and yet we do not see; <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_609">LIGHT</a>, then, must be absent. Evidently, light<br>
and yet we do not see; light, then, must be absent. Evidently, <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_609">LIGHT</a><br>
Strangely enough, Plato and Aristotle regarded <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_614">LIGHT</a> as a property of<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_619">LIGHT</a> has its source in the object and not in the eye, and travels<br>
to the art of photography. Here <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_622">LIGHT</a> rays produce effects which are<br>
and Aristotle. The source of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_627">LIGHT</a> to him was the luminous body. Such<br>
maintained that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_634">LIGHT</a> was a wave phenomenon, the disturbance starting<br>
seemed to offer no satisfactory explanation as to why <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_639">LIGHT</a> travelled<br>
like the rays of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_642">LIGHT</a>, be propagated in straight lines, without a<br>
explain how <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_650">LIGHT</a> could traverse some types of matter--liquids, for<br>
example--Newton supposed that these <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_651">LIGHT</a> particles travelled in the<br>
convincingly by Huyghens. Today we know that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_655">LIGHT</a> waves of high<br>
to Newton's theory, the velocity of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_662">LIGHT</a> must be greater in a denser<br>
to the wave theory the reverse is true. Foucault showed that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_664">LIGHT</a><br>
Huyghens' wave theory of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_715">LIGHT</a>, now so generally accepted, loses its<br>
of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_747">LIGHT</a>, and for want of any other more plausible alternative, we<br>
alternative. In the meantime, if <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_750">LIGHT</a> is to be considered as a wave<br>
of the sea, what is the medium for the waves of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_753">LIGHT</a>? Again we answer,<br>
beyond? Nothing but the ether, it is claimed. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_761">LIGHT</a> from the sun and<br>
of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_798">LIGHT</a> waves. Waves which have a powerful chemical action--those<br>

The Electromagnetic Theory of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_807">LIGHT</a>. Powerful support to the conception<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_809">LIGHT</a> to be an electromagnetic phenomenon. From purely theoretical<br>
proved that such waves would travel with the same velocity as <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_812">LIGHT</a><br>
same velocity as <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_817">LIGHT</a>, were enabled to do so with the help of the<br>
same medium as <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_818">LIGHT</a>, namely, the ether.<br>
It was now but a step for Maxwell to formulate the theory that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_820">LIGHT</a><br>
itself is nothing but an electrical phenomenon, the sensation of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_821">LIGHT</a><br>
brought up in a school which had taught that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_824">LIGHT</a> and electricity<br>
the ether, comparable, in so far as velocity is concerned, to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_831">LIGHT</a><br>
Just as there is a close connection between <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_837">LIGHT</a> and electricity,<br>
so there is between <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_838">LIGHT</a> and magnetism. The first to point out such<br>
field on <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_851">LIGHT</a>.<br>
only difference between wireless and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_856">LIGHT</a> waves is that the former<br>
slower. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_858">LIGHT</a> and wireless waves bear a relationship to one another<br>
of such waves. What charges give rise to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_862">LIGHT</a> waves? Lorentz, from<br>
to electricity, and electrons in vibration, to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_868">LIGHT</a>. The Zeeman effect<br>
with Zeeman's experiments on magnetism and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_873">LIGHT</a>.<br>
nature. But now if matter and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_923">LIGHT</a> have the same origin, and matter<br>
is subject to gravitation, why not <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_924">LIGHT</a> also? So reasoned Einstein.<br>
of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_937">LIGHT</a>.<br>
velocity of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_941">LIGHT</a> in water is less than in air, which is the very<br>
discovery that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_951">LIGHT</a> is an electromagnetic phenomenon; that the waves<br>
set up by a source of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_952">LIGHT</a> were comparable to waves set up by an<br>
Zeeman next showed that magnetism was also, closely related to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_955">LIGHT</a>.<br>
to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_960">LIGHT</a>.<br>
If matter and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_967">LIGHT</a> have the same origin, and if matter is subject<br>
to gravitation, why not <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_968">LIGHT</a> also?<br>
For the general subject of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_975">LIGHT</a> the reader must be referred to a<br>

suppose that the path of a ray of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1102">LIGHT</a> would be affected by the son?<br>
mass attract one another. If <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1105">LIGHT</a> has mass--and very recent work<br>
tends to show that it has--there is no reason why <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1106">LIGHT</a> should not be<br>
agitated scientists was not so much whether a ray of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1108">LIGHT</a> would be<br>
on <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1114">LIGHT</a> rays coming from the stars. Under ordinary conditions,<br>
around it, including rays of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1116">LIGHT</a> passing near its surface, are wholly<br>
its <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1121">LIGHT</a> comes to us the ray just grazes the sun. If the path of<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1135">LIGHT</a> consists of corpuscles, or minute particles, emitted from<br>
the source of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1136">LIGHT</a>. If this be true these particles, having mass,<br>
shown that such a gravitational pull would displace the ray of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1139">LIGHT</a><br>
On the other hand, where <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1141">LIGHT</a> is regarded as waves set in motion in<br>
the "ether" of space (the wave theory of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1142">LIGHT</a>), and where weight is<br>
denied <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1143">LIGHT</a> altogether, no deviation need be expected. Finally there<br>
is a third alternative: Einstein's. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1144">LIGHT</a>, says Einstein, has mass,<br>
and therefore probably weight. Mass is the matter <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1145">LIGHT</a> contains;<br>
weight represents pull by gravity. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1146">LIGHT</a> rays will be attracted by<br>
prediction. A very definite result has been obtained that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1188">LIGHT</a> is<br>
We have already alluded to our view of the nature of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1264">LIGHT</a>, known as<br>
the wave theory of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1265">LIGHT</a>. This theory postulates the existence of an<br>
all-pervading "ether" in space. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1266">LIGHT</a> sets up wave disturbances in<br>
motion. Now suppose we send a beam of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1297">LIGHT</a> a certain distance up<br>
beam of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1299">LIGHT</a> at right angles and send it an equal distance across<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1301">LIGHT</a> to travel in these two directions compare? Reasoning by analogy,<br>
could be detected between the beam of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1305">LIGHT</a> travelling up-and-down,<br>
But if no ether, how are we to explain the propagation of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1312">LIGHT</a> in<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1321">LIGHT</a>--is so revolutionary an idea that Larmor and Lorentz would<br>
attempt to explain Michelson's anomalous results in the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1368">LIGHT</a> of an<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1391">LIGHT</a> to travel from B to the distance M. A on the earth has means<br>
velocity of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1396">LIGHT</a> is independent of its source, the difference in<br>
"Precisely the same is true if you substitute <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1419">LIGHT</a> rays for sound<br>

Maxwell showed that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1880">LIGHT</a> must be regarded as an electromagnetic<br>
of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1882">LIGHT</a> (which may be the equivalent of the motion of the earth<br>
with reference to the sun) with respect to the velocity of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1883">LIGHT</a><br>
out from radium with a speed comparable to that of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1887">LIGHT</a>, how are we<br>
c denoting the velocity of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1898">LIGHT</a> in vacuo (which, according to all<br>
motion). Here, you see, electrodynamical systems (<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1900">LIGHT</a> and therefore<br>
results actually point to the velocity of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1915">LIGHT</a> as showing the<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1917">LIGHT</a> possesses universal significance; and this is the basis for<br>
anyone that the use of a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1962">LIGHT</a>-signal as a means of connection between<br>
as the velocity of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1971">LIGHT</a>, rather than relatively small ones--and even<br>
velocity of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1973">LIGHT</a>--discrepancies between theory and experiment would<br>
out, is comparable to that of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1989">LIGHT</a>; whereas before the advent of the<br>
electron, the velocity of no particles comparable to that of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1990">LIGHT</a><br>
that of the constancy of the velocity of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2082">LIGHT</a> in a vacuum. Light<br>
that of the constancy of the velocity of light in a vacuum. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2082">LIGHT</a><br>
2. The deviation of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2160">LIGHT</a>-rays in a gravitational field (confirmed<br>
in the case of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2164">LIGHT</a> coming to us from stars of appreciable mass<br>

of any entity, e.g., a particle of matter, a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2387">LIGHT</a>-wave, etc., he<br>

and consequently a ray of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2639">LIGHT</a> might fall within the province of<br>
path of a projectile and a ray of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2644">LIGHT</a> would both appear straight;<br>
so that, if the projectile had a velocity equal to that of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2645">LIGHT</a>, it<br>
and the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2646">LIGHT</a> wave would travel side by side. To an observer outside<br>

definite result has been obtained that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2788">LIGHT</a> is deflected according<br>
it as an effect of the weight of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2816">LIGHT</a>. We know that momentum is<br>

Had the older <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1970">MASTERS</a> the occasion to study enormous velocities, such<br>

important thing in the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1835">MATERIAL</a> universe. I believe that matter<br>

The nature of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_979">MATTER</a> and electricity is excellently discussed in<br>
Troland's The Nature of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_982">MATTER</a> and Electricity (D. Van Nostrand Co.,<br>
1919). Two other very readable books are Soddy's <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_983">MATTER</a> and Energy<br>

<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_663">MEDIUM</a> (such as water) than in a lighter one (such as air). According<br>
entire significance if a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_716">MEDIUM</a> for the propagation of these waves<br>
is left out of consideration. This <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_717">MEDIUM</a> we call the ether. [2]<br>
is some go-between? some <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_733">MEDIUM</a> not readily perceptible to the senses<br>
If we can but picture some such <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_736">MEDIUM</a> we can imagine our magnet<br>
giving rise to vibrations in this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_737">MEDIUM</a> which are carried to the<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_739">MEDIUM</a> nearest to it; then this portion hands over the disturbance<br>

of being a rope is the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_744">MEDIUM</a> called the ether.<br>

which these waves are propagated? If water is the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_752">MEDIUM</a> for the waves<br>
of the sea, what is the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_753">MEDIUM</a> for the waves of light? Again we answer,<br>
the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_754">MEDIUM</a> is the ether.<br>

same <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_818">MEDIUM</a> as light, namely, the ether.<br>
But Huyghens' wave theory postulated some <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_945">MEDIUM</a> in which the waves<br>
can act. To this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_946">MEDIUM</a> the name "ether" was given. However, all<br>

The nearest body in space to the earth is the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_335">MOON</a>, some 240,000 miles<br>

perhaps the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_337">MOON</a> itself has attractive power? If so, since the apple<br>
would be much nearer the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_338">MOON</a> than the earth, the probabilities are<br>
matter, large and small. Now there is the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_343">MOON</a> itself, a very large<br>
body. Does the earth exert any gravitational pull on the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_344">MOON</a>? To<br>

But then if the earth attracts the moon, why does not the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_349">MOON</a> fall<br>

earth every month. Now if the earth were absent the path of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_355">MOON</a><br>

The only reason, then, why the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_364">MOON</a> does not fall to the earth is on<br>
Newton reasoned that what keeps the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_369">MOON</a> revolving around the earth is<br>
be in order that the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_376">MOON</a> may continue in its path. He next compared<br>

Newton showed that the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_401">MOON</a>, the sun, the planets--every body in space<br>
conformed to this law. The earth attracts the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_402">MOON</a>; but so does the<br>

moon the earth. If the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_403">MOON</a> revolves around the earth rather than the<br>
earth around the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_404">MOON</a>, it is because the earth is a much larger body,<br>

<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_437">MOON</a> would be that of an ellipse, with one of the foci of this ellipse<br>

course of these revolutions the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1091">MOON</a> must come directly between the<br>

Newton's laws of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_513">MOTION</a> are really axioms, like the axioms of Euclid:<br>
told by Newton that "the alteration of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_519">MOTION</a> is ever proportional<br>
"Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_525">MOTION</a> in a<br>

We have no definite means of proving that a body once set in <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_537">MOTION</a><br>

changes the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_545">MOTION</a> of a body. His second law deals with the relation<br>

Einstein's work is so largely dependent upon the work of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_84">NEWTON</a> and<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_85">NEWTON</a>'s successors, the first two chapters are devoted to the latter.<br>

In speaking of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_189">NEWTON</a> we are tempted to paraphrase a line from the<br>
Scriptures: Before <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_190">NEWTON</a> the Solar System was without form, and void;<br>
then <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_191">NEWTON</a> came and there was light. To have discovered a law not<br>
and stars beyond, is a triumph which places <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_193">NEWTON</a> among the super-men.<br>
What <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_195">NEWTON</a>'s law of gravitation must have meant to the people of his<br>
touch with beings on another planet. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_198">NEWTON</a>'s law increased confidence<br>

It must not be supposed that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_316">NEWTON</a> "discovered" gravity. Apples<br>
had been seen to fall before <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_317">NEWTON</a>'s time, and the reason for their<br>

Let us follow <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_328">NEWTON</a> in his train of thought. An apple falls from a<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_369">NEWTON</a> reasoned that what keeps the moon revolving around the earth is<br>
for from these <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_373">NEWTON</a> deduced the hypothesis that attraction varies<br>

Further Developments of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_408">NEWTON</a>'s Law of Gravitation. When we speak of<br>
might well appear hopeless. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_416">NEWTON</a> was able to present the problem<br>

If this great law of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_424">NEWTON</a>'s found such general application beyond our<br>

Both <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_503">NEWTON</a> and Einstein were led to their theory of gravitation<br>
by profound studies of the mathematics of motion, but as <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_504">NEWTON</a>'s<br>
of motion to matter were made subsequent to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_507">NEWTON</a>'s time, we need not<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_509">NEWTON</a>'s is probably but an approximation of the truth. If we confine<br>
our attention to our own solar system, the deviation from <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_510">NEWTON</a>'s<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_513">NEWTON</a>'s laws of motion are really axioms, like the axioms of Euclid:<br>
told by <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_519">NEWTON</a> that "the alteration of motion is ever proportional<br>
impressed thereon." So runs <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_527">NEWTON</a>'s first law of motion. A body does<br>
line. What <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_539">NEWTON</a> meant was that a body would continue moving provided<br>

It may well be asked, what bearing have these laws of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_565">NEWTON</a> on the<br>
involved and the space covered; and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_568">NEWTON</a>'s equations for measuring<br>

to some of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_578">NEWTON</a>'s contributions to optics, because here more than<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_582">NEWTON</a> turned his attention to optics in 1666 when he proved that<br>
which had occasioned so much annoyance to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_590">NEWTON</a> and his predecessors<br>
together in a volume on optics which <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_594">NEWTON</a> published in 1704. Our<br>

This emission or corpuscular theory of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_632">NEWTON</a>'s was combated<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_638">NEWTON</a>'s strongest objection to Huyghens' wave theory was that it<br>

<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_654">NEWTON</a>'s objection to the wave theory was not answered very<br>
of a doubt that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_661">NEWTON</a>'s corpuscular theory was untenable. According<br>
to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_662">NEWTON</a>'s theory, the velocity of light must be greater in a denser<br>

Observation tells us that the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1588">ORBIT</a> of Mercury is advancing at the<br>
situation is simply this: in one revolution of the planet the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1601">ORBIT</a><br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2619">ORBIT</a>; whereas Einstein's laws lead to the prediction that the<br>
revolution would start the planet off on an <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2621">ORBIT</a> very approximately<br>
the plane of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2623">ORBIT</a>. When calculations were made for the various<br>

ellipse--that is, oval--and the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1573">PLANET</a> would travel indefinitely along<br>
but before a revolution would be quite completed, the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1575">PLANET</a> would<br>
in which the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1578">PLANET</a> is moving. After many years--centuries--the orbit<br>
of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1582">PLANET</a>. Mercury moving at the rate of 30 miles a second is the<br>
situation is simply this: in one revolution of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1601">PLANET</a> the orbit<br>
square of the ratio of the velocity of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1603">PLANET</a> to the velocity<br>
the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1642">PLANET</a> Mercury), and the deviation of light rays in a gravitational<br>
of a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2062">PLANET</a> with reference to the total assemblage of visible fixed<br>
(confirmed in the case of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2158">PLANET</a> Mercury).<br>
3. According to Newton's law an isolated <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2617">PLANET</a> in its motion around a<br>
revolution would start the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2621">PLANET</a> off on an orbit very approximately<br>
attracted by the sun, or any other <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1107">PLANETARY</a> body. The question that<br>
body? How do we know that our <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1258">PLANETARY</a> system, and the stars, and<br>
only applicable to matter on this earth, but to the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_192">PLANETS</a> and sun<br>
the center of the universe, it was but one of several <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_240">PLANETS</a> revolving<br>
which postulated that the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_249">PLANETS</a> revolved around the sun, and planets<br>
which postulated that the planets revolved around the sun, and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_249">PLANETS</a><br>
against the Copernican theory that the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_280">PLANETS</a> revolve in circles. This<br>
victim. The sun no longer moved, but the earth and the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_286">PLANETS</a> did,<br>
Kepler's observation of the elliptical rotation of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_303">PLANETS</a> was the<br>
for Newton's law. Why did the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_305">PLANETS</a> move in just this way? Kepler<br>
and the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_324">PLANETS</a> could be explained on the basis of gravitation. But<br>
the movements of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_372">PLANETS</a> around the sun was of inestimable value;<br>
all the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_390">PLANETS</a> is regulated by the same means?<br>
Newton showed that the moon, the sun, the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_401">PLANETS</a>--every body in space<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_465">PLANETS</a>. Then, from these forces, by other propositions which are<br>
also mathematical, we deduce the motions of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_466">PLANETS</a>, the comets,<br>
to the velocity of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_777">PLANETS</a> in it? Why is not the velocity of<br>
the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_778">PLANETS</a> reduced in time, just as the velocity of a rifle bullet<br>
away. The sun has its family of eight <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1055">PLANETS</a>--of which the earth is<br>
one--which travel around the sun; and around some of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1056">PLANETS</a> there<br>
in the sky is a sun comparable to our own, having also its own <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1060">PLANETS</a><br>
and therefore it would exert a far greater pull than any of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1113">PLANETS</a><br>
of our other <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1235">PLANETS</a>. With our time as a basis, it takes Jupiter or<br>
say the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1389">PLANETS</a> Venus and the earth, with an observer B on Venus<br>
fastest among the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1583">PLANETS</a>. It has the further advantage over Venus or<br>
of this is due to the gravitational influence of other <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1590">PLANETS</a>. It<br>

For nearly a century Dalton stood as firm as a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_902">ROCK</a>. But early<br>
forever of the propriety of speaking of the "true" length of a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2213">ROD</a> or<br>
of a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2219">ROD</a> when it is moving in the direction of its own length with<br>
two ways of assigning a number to the length of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2221">ROD</a> concerned. One<br>
method is to imagine the observer moving with the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2222">ROD</a>, applying along<br>
ends of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2224">ROD</a>. Another method would be to have two observers at rest<br>
on the body with reference to which the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2225">ROD</a> has the uniform velocity,<br>
so stationed along the line of motion of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2226">ROD</a> that as the rod<br>
so stationed along the line of motion of the rod that as the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2226">ROD</a><br>
scale the positions of the two ends of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2228">ROD</a>. Einstein showed that,<br>
velocity of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2232">ROD</a> was increased. In assigning a number, therefore,<br>
to the length of a moving <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2233">ROD</a>, one must make a choice of the method to<br>
that the observer shall move with the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2235">ROD</a>, carrying his measuring<br>
relations. The observed fact that, if we measure the length of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2237">ROD</a><br>
on different days, or when the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2238">ROD</a> is lying in different positions,<br>
"real" length of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2240">ROD</a>. It may have changed, or it may not. It<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2242">ROD</a> is simply a process of comparison between it and an arbitrary<br>
standard, e.g., a meter-<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2243">ROD</a> or yard-stick. In regard to the problem<br>
of a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2275">ROD</a>, for instance, on the earth and then were able to carry the<br>

gravitation, and, incidentally, to his conception of time and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_927">SPACE</a><br>

absolute time, or absolute <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1221">SPACE</a>. All things are relative. We say<br>

<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1313">SPACE</a>, and various electrical phenomena connected with it, such as<br>
all bodies within the ether may be referred to it; any point in <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1356">SPACE</a><br>
we are to ignore it, how are we to get the velocity of bodies in <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1358">SPACE</a>?<br>

time and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1377">SPACE</a> were entirely different, in no way to be confounded.<br>
Just as Newton conceived of absolute <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1379">SPACE</a>, so he conceived of absolute<br>

in space is another time on another body in <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1403">SPACE</a>. There is nothing<br>
intimately associated with our method of measuring <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1436">SPACE</a>, the distance<br>
between two points. As we proceed we find that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1437">SPACE</a> without time has<br>
that "time by itself and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1439">SPACE</a> by itself are mere shadows; they are<br>
the facts of the physical world." Einstein incorporated this time-<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1441">SPACE</a><br>

with <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1476">SPACE</a> and time.<br>
is thus with us when we attempt to picture four-dimensional <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1486">SPACE</a>.<br>

The Time-<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1496">SPACE</a> Idea Further Developed. We have already alluded to the<br>
fact that objects in <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1497">SPACE</a> moving with different velocities build up<br>

<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1504">SPACE</a>; neither is Arcturus' time our time. And what is true of the<br>
discrepancies existing between the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1505">SPACE</a> and time conceptions of the<br>
earth and Arcturus is true of any other two bodies in <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1506">SPACE</a> moving<br>
But is there no relationship existing between the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1509">SPACE</a> and time<br>
of one body in the universe as compared to the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1510">SPACE</a> and time of<br>

Summary. Velocity, or movement in <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1616">SPACE</a>, is at the basis of Einstein's<br>

definitions and postulates which we adopt. The words "absolute" <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2216">SPACE</a><br>
instrument with him. This disposes of the problem of measuring <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2236">SPACE</a><br>
this method Einstein developed a system of measuring both <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2271">SPACE</a> and<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2283">SPACE</a> and time intervals, i.e., he would have a definite system<br>
of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2284">SPACE</a> coordinates (x, y, z) and a definite time coordinate (t);<br>

is necessary, three for the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2317">SPACE</a> specification and one for the time. A<br>
reference to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2321">SPACE</a>. Discussing the laws of electromagnetic phenomena,<br>
Minkowski showed how in a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2322">SPACE</a> of four dimensions, by a suitable<br>
to his method, to represent a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2332">SPACE</a>-time point using the method of<br>
measuring <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2333">SPACE</a> and time intervals as outlined by Einstein; and, if<br>
means that there is no one direction in the four-dimensional <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2349">SPACE</a><br>
three-dimensional <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2358">SPACE</a>, we have a plane, i.e., a two-dimensional<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2359">SPACE</a>. Similarly, if a section is made through a four-dimensional<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2360">SPACE</a>, one of three dimensions is obtained. Thus, for an observer on<br>
the earth a definite section of Minkowski's four-dimensional <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2361">SPACE</a> will<br>
as it were, break up Minkowski's <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2363">SPACE</a> into our space and give us our<br>

the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2367">SPACE</a> defined by Minkowski is completely isotropic in reference<br>
observer, of course, a particular section will cause the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2370">SPACE</a> to<br>
it is obvious that, since this four-dimensional <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2374">SPACE</a> is isotropic,<br>
the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2385">SPACE</a>-time characteristics of any event a point, defined by its<br>
observes a sequence of points in the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2388">SPACE</a>-time continuum; that is,<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2390">SPACE</a>. Such a line was called by Minkowski a "world-line." Further,<br>
imagines the line forming a part of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2434">SPACE</a>, it is evident that<br>
if the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2435">SPACE</a> is deformed by compression or expansion the shape of<br>
possible, by deforming the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2437">SPACE</a>, to make the line take any shape<br>
as a deformation of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2440">SPACE</a>. Thus I can draw a line on a sheet of paper<br>
Now, consider world-lines in our four-dimensional <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2445">SPACE</a>. The<br>
intersections of such lines. By analogy I can draw in ordinary <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2447">SPACE</a><br>
sequence of intersections. So in the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2451">SPACE</a> of our world-lines, the<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2452">SPACE</a> may be deformed in any imaginable manner without introducing<br>
our <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2456">SPACE</a> is equivalent mathematically to a transformation of axes,<br>
the observer would describe its path as being straight. In this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2522">SPACE</a><br>
the infinitesimal interval between two <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2523">SPACE</a>-time points would then<br>

a gravitational field are not those discussed by Euclid; the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2600">SPACE</a> is,<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2699">SPACE</a>; but by means of gyroscopes we can learn a great deal about its<br>
of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2707">SPACE</a> of vast quantities of matter, a proposition which is not<br>
attractive. deSitter has suggested a peculiar quality of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2708">SPACE</a><br>

<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_164">THEORY</a> of gravitation since Newton's day. Einstein's reasoning is<br>
strengthened his belief in the Copernican <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_256">THEORY</a>. "It (the Copernican<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_257">THEORY</a>) explains to me the cause of many phenomena which under the<br>
generally accepted <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_258">THEORY</a> are quite unintelligible. I have collected<br>
against the Copernican <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_280">THEORY</a> that the planets revolve in circles. This<br>
plausible <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_477">THEORY</a> as to the nature of this gravitational force. We<br>
relativity <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_488">THEORY</a> is indifferent to hypotheses as to the nature of<br>
Both Newton and Einstein were led to their <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_503">THEORY</a> of gravitation<br>
their philosophy in other directions would have been the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_618">THEORY</a> that<br>
This emission or corpuscular <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_632">THEORY</a> of Newton's was combated<br>
Newton's strongest objection to Huyghens' wave <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_638">THEORY</a> was that it<br>
In the corpuscular <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_647">THEORY</a> the particles emitted by the luminous<br>
Newton's objection to the wave <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_654">THEORY</a> was not answered very<br>
of a doubt that Newton's corpuscular <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_661">THEORY</a> was untenable. According<br>
to Newton's <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_662">THEORY</a>, the velocity of light must be greater in a denser<br>

Newton and in favor of Huyghens; and where facts and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_666">THEORY</a> clash<br>
there is but one thing to do: discard the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_667">THEORY</a>.<br>
Huyghens' wave <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_715">THEORY</a> of light, now so generally accepted, loses its<br>
Foucault's experiment completely shattered the corpuscular <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_746">THEORY</a><br>
are thrown back on Huyghens' wave <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_748">THEORY</a>. It will presently appear<br>
that this wave <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_749">THEORY</a> has elements in it which make it an excellent<br>

The Electromagnetic <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_807">THEORY</a> of Light. Powerful support to the conception<br>
It was now but a step for Maxwell to formulate the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_820">THEORY</a> that light<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_823">THEORY</a> met with considerable opposition at first. Physicists had been<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_828">THEORY</a>. One was an experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theoretical<br>
John Dalton more than a hundred years ago postulated a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_890">THEORY</a>, now<br>
known as the atomic <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_891">THEORY</a>, to explain one of the fundamental laws<br>
in chemistry. This <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_892">THEORY</a> started out with an old Greek assumption<br>
Summary. Newton's studies of matter in motion led to his <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_926">THEORY</a> of<br>
as definite entities. As we shall see, Einstein in his <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_928">THEORY</a> of<br>
period. One of these is Minkowski's <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_930">THEORY</a> of time and space as one<br>
and inseparable. This <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_931">THEORY</a> we shall discuss at some length in the<br>
researches which culminated in the electron <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_935">THEORY</a> of matter. The<br>
origin of this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_936">THEORY</a> may be traced to studies dealing with the nature<br>
Here again Newton appears as a pioneer. Newton's corpuscular <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_939">THEORY</a>,<br>
reverse of what the corpuscular <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_942">THEORY</a> demands, but which does agree<br>
with Huyghens' wave <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_943">THEORY</a>.<br>
But Huyghens' wave <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_945">THEORY</a> postulated some medium in which the waves<br>
Huyghens' wave <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_950">THEORY</a> received a new lease of life with Maxwell's<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1000">THEORY</a> of gravitation since Newton's day. Einstein's reasoning is<br>
was based on a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1036">THEORY</a> of gravitation which Einstein had developed in<br>

relativity than in Newton's <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1197">THEORY</a> of gravitation, Einstein so changed<br>
But now we must turn our attention very briefly to the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1211">THEORY</a> of<br>
relativity--the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1212">THEORY</a> that led up to Einstein's law of gravitation.<br>

How the special <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1980">THEORY</a> of relativity (see Note 4) led to the general<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1981">THEORY</a> of relativity (which included gravitation) may now be briefly<br>
The special <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2001">THEORY</a> of relativity, however, takes into account only<br>
This means that a more general <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2007">THEORY</a> of relativity is required to<br>
include gravitational phenomena. Hence Einstein's General <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2008">THEORY</a> of<br>
Relativity. Hence the approach to a new <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2009">THEORY</a> of gravitation. Hence<br>
There are several kinds of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2031">THEORY</a> in physics. Most of them are<br>
of some relatively simple proposition. The kinetic <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2033">THEORY</a> of gases,<br>

The theory of relativity is a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2053">THEORY</a> of principle. To understand it,<br>
these it is necessary to point out that the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2055">THEORY</a> of relativity is<br>
like a house with two separate stories, the special relativity <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2056">THEORY</a><br>
and the general <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2057">THEORY</a> of relativity.<br>
a system of inertia. The special relativity <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2075">THEORY</a> is therefore the<br>
The second principle on which the special relativity <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2081">THEORY</a> rests is<br>
proposition to the Maxwell-Lorentz <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2085">THEORY</a> of electro-dynamics.<br>

of this general <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2122">THEORY</a> of relativity was found to be in conflict<br>
This slight sketch indicates how a generalized <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2135">THEORY</a> of relativity<br>

Thus the new <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2151">THEORY</a> of gravitation diverges widely from that of Newton<br>
The great attraction of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2167">THEORY</a> is its logical consistency. If<br>

explanation? Granting that the two clocks register the same <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1394">TIME</a><br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1397">TIME</a> is due to the fact that the planet Venus moves with reference to<br>
simply another way of saying that what is a certain <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1402">TIME</a> on one body<br>
in space is another <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1403">TIME</a> on another body in space. There is nothing<br>
definite in <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1404">TIME</a>.<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1422">TIME</a> to cover its five-minute intervals than does the chronometer in<br>
which is true of the clock is, of course, also true of all <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1425">TIME</a><br>
Your <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1430">TIME</a> has apparently come to a standstill in one position and<br>
that <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1432">TIME</a> alone has little meaning.<br>
thoroughly reorganise our method of measuring <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1435">TIME</a>. But this is<br>
between two points. As we proceed we find that space without <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1437">TIME</a> has<br>
that "<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1439">TIME</a> by itself and space by itself are mere shadows; they are<br>
the facts of the physical world." Einstein incorporated this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1441">TIME</a>-space<br>
terms. Minkowski and Einstein picture <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1460">TIME</a> as the fourth dimension. To<br>
them <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1461">TIME</a> occupies no more important position than length, breadth,<br>
this spirit when in his novel, "The <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1464">TIME</a> Machine," he makes his hero<br>
travel backwards and forwards along <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1465">TIME</a> just as a man might go north<br>
or south. When the man with his <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1466">TIME</a> machine goes forward he is in<br>
with space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1476">TIME</a>.<br>
the sensation of space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1493">TIME</a>--four dimensions. Space and time<br>
the sensation of space and time--four dimensions. Space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1493">TIME</a><br>
The <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1496">TIME</a>-space Idea Further Developed. We have already alluded to the<br>
different <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1498">TIME</a> intervals. Thus the velocity of the star Arcturus, if<br>
space; neither is Arcturus' <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1504">TIME</a> our time. And what is true of the<br>
space; neither is Arcturus' time our <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1504">TIME</a>. And what is true of the<br>
discrepancies existing between the space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1505">TIME</a> conceptions of the<br>
But is there no relationship existing between the space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1509">TIME</a><br>
of one body in the universe as compared to the space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1510">TIME</a> of<br>
concept of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1513">TIME</a> and space interlinked; of time as the fourth dimension,<br>
concept of time and space interlinked; of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1513">TIME</a> as the fourth dimension,<br>
length, breadth and thickness being the other three; of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1514">TIME</a> as<br>
the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1518">TIME</a>-space relationships of all bodies in the cosmos, and hence<br>
have a universality which is totally lacking when <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1519">TIME</a> and space<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1521">TIME</a>-space are up-and-down, right-and-left, backwards-and-forwards,<br>
How Einstein's Conception of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1538">TIME</a> and Space Led to a New View of<br>
what amounts to the same thing, a "distortion" or "strain" of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1542">TIME</a><br>
of the laws of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1545">TIME</a> and space. "The earth," Prof. Eddington tells us,<br>
space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1548">TIME</a> which have been tangled up by an influence radiating<br>
much <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1568">TIME</a> and energy on this theory of Einstein's but for the fact<br>
work, as it was at the basis of Newton's. But <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1617">TIME</a> and space no<br>
the help of Newton's equations. <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1619">TIME</a> and space are not independent but<br>
revised conception of space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1626">TIME</a> to elucidate cosmical<br>
space, consisting of space-<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1628">TIME</a> combinations (the four dimensions),<br>
world-lines, or, what amounts to the same thing, strains of space-<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1633">TIME</a><br>
conception of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1635">TIME</a> and space.<br>
revolutionary ideas propounded regarding <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1660">TIME</a> and space, the brilliant<br>
is for the first <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1662">TIME</a> linked up with other properties of matter,<br>
merit--stamps Einstein as one of those super-men who from <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1665">TIME</a> to<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1666">TIME</a> are sent to us to give us a peep into the beyond.<br>
confer the medal upon him] as a harbinger of a better <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1710">TIME</a> in which<br>
deduced some startling conceptions of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1904">TIME</a> and space.<br>
to Einstein. "It is possible to select a suitable <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1957">TIME</a>-coordinate<br>
in such a way that a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1958">TIME</a>-measurement enters into physical laws<br>
of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1965">TIME</a> measurements in different systems." (Freundlich). But that<br>
is just what Einstein shows, because <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1966">TIME</a>-measurements are based on<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2026">TIME</a>, SPACE, AND GRAVITATION [14]<br>
Since the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2059">TIME</a> of the ancient Greeks it has been well known that in<br>
in the doctrine of the physical laws of space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2091">TIME</a>. It became<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2146">TIME</a>, kinematics, is no longer one of the absolute foundations of<br>
led to the deduction of a new variable which should replace the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2197">TIME</a><br>
of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2210">TIME</a> and space, as ordinarily stated and used. He analyzed clearly<br>
speak with exactness of a length or of an interval of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2212">TIME</a>. He disposed<br>
of the "true" duration of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2214">TIME</a>, showing, in fact, that the numerical<br>
values which we attach to lengths or intervals of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2215">TIME</a> depend upon the<br>
or <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2217">TIME</a> intervals are devoid of meaning. As an illustration of what<br>
accepting two postulates which need no defense at this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2229">TIME</a>, the two<br>
of assigning numbers to intervals of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2244">TIME</a>, it must be borne in mind<br>
that we do not select a unit interval of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2246">TIME</a> and find how many times<br>
practical instruments for assigning numbers to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2249">TIME</a>-intervals depend<br>
a perfectly uniform manner, each vibration taking the same <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2251">TIME</a> as<br>
of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2254">TIME</a>; and it is not a particularly good definition at that. Its<br>
intervals of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2258">TIME</a> as such intervals as are required for the entity<br>
intervals of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2266">TIME</a> is complete. This implies, of course, that there is<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2272">TIME</a> intervals. As a matter of fact his system is identically that<br>
space and <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2283">TIME</a> intervals, i.e., he would have a definite system<br>
of space coordinates (x, y, z) and a definite <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2284">TIME</a> coordinate (t);<br>
Einstein discussed many other most important questions at this <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2299">TIME</a>;<br>

values of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2340">TIME</a> are laid off, Minkowski defined his fourth coordinate<br>
as the product of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2341">TIME</a> and the imaginary constant, the square root of<br>
that corresponds to <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2350">TIME</a> for all observers. Just as with reference to<br>

that of the constancy of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2082">VELOCITY</a> of light in a vacuum. Light<br>
in a vacuum has a definite and constant <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2083">VELOCITY</a>, independent of<br>
the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2084">VELOCITY</a> of its source. Physicists owe their confidence in this<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2192">VELOCITY</a>. One object of such an investigation would be to determine<br>
a uniform <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2220">VELOCITY</a>, that is, after having adopted a scale of length,<br>
on the body with reference to which the rod has the uniform <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2225">VELOCITY</a>,<br>

of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_462">WORLD</a>; for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated<br>
conception of the external <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_602">WORLD</a> is largely based upon the sense<br>
"I do not know," wrote Newton, "what I may appear to the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_683">WORLD</a>,<br>

influence of gravity on these <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1534">WORLD</a>-lines; it is the "strain" brought<br>
even more, for it is a true representation of the real <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_1536">WORLD</a>.<br>

the thermometer tube. In other words, thinking of the <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2395">WORLD</a>-line<br>

perception of the intersection of <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2402">WORLD</a>-lines. Further, since all we<br>
know of a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2403">WORLD</a>-line is the result of observations, it is evident<br>
that we do not know a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2404">WORLD</a>-line as a continuous series of points,<br>

It is clear, moreover, that for the description of a <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2408">WORLD</a>-line<br>
Now, consider <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2445">WORLD</a>-lines in our four-dimensional space. The<br>
sequence of intersections. So in the space of our <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2451">WORLD</a>-lines, the<br>
Now, at last we come to gravitation. We can not imagine any <a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2461">WORLD</a>-line<br>
<a href="newtonToEinstein.html#line_2465">WORLD</a>-lines, this means that, if the world-lines of two isolated<br>
