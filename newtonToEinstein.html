Einstein's contributions to our ideas of time and space, and to our<span id = line_79> [79] </span>
<br>
knowledge of the universe in general, are of so momentous a nature,<span id = line_80> [80] </span>
<br>
that they easily take their place among the two or three greatest<span id = line_81> [81] </span>
<br>
achievements of the twentieth century. This little book attempts<span id = line_82> [82] </span>
<br>
to give, in popular form, an account of this work. As, however,<span id = line_83> [83] </span>
<br>
Einstein's work is so largely dependent upon the work of Newton and<span id = line_84> [84] </span>
<br>
Newton's successors, the first two chapters are devoted to the latter.<span id = line_85> [85] </span>

The preparation of this new edition has made it possible to correct<span id = line_96> [96] </span>
<br>
errors, to further amplify certain portions of the text and to<span id = line_97> [97] </span>
<br>
enlarge the ever-increasing bibliography on the subject. Photographs<span id = line_98> [98] </span>
<br>
of Professors J. J. Thomson, Michelson, Minkowski and Lorentz are<span id = line_99> [99] </span>

also new features in this edition.<span id = line_100> [100] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_101> [101] </span>
<br>
The explanatory notes and articles in the Appendix will, I believe,<span id = line_102> [102] </span>
<br>
present no difficulties to readers who have mastered the contents of<span id = line_103> [103] </span>
<br>
the book. They are in fact "popular expositions" of various phases<span id = line_104> [104] </span>
<br>
of the Einstein theory; but experience has shown that even "popular<span id = line_105> [105] </span>
<br>
expositions" of the theory need further "popular introductions."<span id = line_106> [106] </span>

<span id = line_188> [188] </span>
<br>
In speaking of Newton we are tempted to paraphrase a line from the<span id = line_189> [189] </span>
<br>
Scriptures: Before Newton the Solar System was without form, and void;<span id = line_190> [190] </span>
<br>
then Newton came and there was light. To have discovered a law not<span id = line_191> [191] </span>
<br>
only applicable to matter on this earth, but to the planets and sun<span id = line_192> [192] </span>
<br>
and stars beyond, is a triumph which places Newton among the super-men.<span id = line_193> [193] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_194> [194] </span>
<br>
What Newton's law of gravitation must have meant to the people of his<span id = line_195> [195] </span>
<br>
day can be pictured only if we conceive what the effect upon us would<span id = line_196> [196] </span>
<br>
be if someone--say Marconi--were actually to succeed in getting into<span id = line_197> [197] </span>
<br>
touch with beings on another planet. Newton's law increased confidence<span id = line_198> [198] </span>
<br>
in the universality of earthly laws; and it strengthened belief in<span id = line_199> [199] </span>
<br>
the cosmos as a law-abiding mechanism.<span id = line_200> [200] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_201> [201] </span>
<br>
Newton's Law. The attraction between any two bodies is proportional<span id = line_202> [202] </span>
<br>
to their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the<span id = line_203> [203] </span>
<br>
distance that separates them. This is the concentrated form of<span id = line_204> [204] </span>
<br>
Newton's law. If we apply this law to two such bodies as the<span id = line_205> [205] </span>
<br>
sun and the earth, we can state that the sun attracts the earth,<span id = line_206> [206] </span>
<br>
and the earth, the sun. Furthermore, this attractive power will<span id = line_207> [207] </span>
<br>
depend upon the distance between these two bodies. Newton showed<span id = line_208> [208] </span>
<br>
that if the distance between the sun and the earth were doubled the<span id = line_209> [209] </span>
<br>
attractive power would be reduced not to one-half, but to one-fourth;<span id = line_210> [210] </span>
<br>
if trebled, the attractive power would be reduced to one-ninth. If,<span id = line_211> [211] </span>
<br>
on the other hand, the distance were halved, the attractive power<span id = line_212> [212] </span>
<br>
would be not merely twice, but four times as great. And what is true<span id = line_213> [213] </span>
<br>
of the sun and the earth is true of every body in the firmament, and,<span id = line_214> [214] </span>
<br>
as Professor Rutherford has recently shown, even of the bodies which<span id = line_215> [215] </span>
<br>
make up the solar system of the almost infinitesimal atom.<span id = line_216> [216] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_217> [217] </span>
<br>
This mysterious attractive power that one body possesses for another is<span id = line_218> [218] </span>
<br>
called "gravitation," and the law which regulates the motion of bodies<span id = line_219> [219] </span>
<br>
when under the spell of gravitation is the law of gravitation. This<span id = line_220> [220] </span>
<br>
law we owe to Newton's genius.<span id = line_221> [221] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_222> [222] </span>
<br>
Newton's Predecessors. We can best appreciate Newton's momentous<span id = line_223> [223] </span>
<br>
contribution to astronomy by casting a rapid glance over the state<span id = line_224> [224] </span>
<br>
of the science prior to the seventeenth century--that is, prior to<span id = line_225> [225] </span>
<br>
Newton's day. Ptolemy's conception of the earth as the center of the<span id = line_226> [226] </span>
<br>
universe held undisputed sway throughout the middle ages. In those days<span id = line_227> [227] </span>
<br>
Ptolemy was in astronomy what Aristotle was in all other knowledge:<span id = line_228> [228] </span>
<br>
they were the gods who could not but be right. Did not Aristotle say<span id = line_229> [229] </span>
<br>
that earth, air, fire and water constituted the four elements? Did<span id = line_230> [230] </span>
<br>
not Ptolemy say that the earth was the center around which the sun<span id = line_231> [231] </span>
<br>
revolved? Why, then, question further? Questioning was a sacrilege.<span id = line_232> [232] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_233> [233] </span>
<br>
Copernicus (1473-1543), however, did question. He studied much and<span id = line_234> [234] </span>
<br>
thought much. He devoted his whole life to the investigation of the<span id = line_235> [235] </span>
<br>
movements of the heavenly bodies. And he came to the conclusion that<span id = line_236> [236] </span>
<br>
Ptolemy and his followers in succeeding ages had expounded views which<span id = line_237> [237] </span>
<br>
were diametrically opposed to the truth. The sun, said Copernicus,<span id = line_238> [238] </span>
<br>
did not move at all, but the earth did; and far from the earth being<span id = line_239> [239] </span>
<br>
the center of the universe, it was but one of several planets revolving<span id = line_240> [240] </span>
<br>
around the sun.<span id = line_241> [241] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_242> [242] </span>
<br>
The influence of the church, coupled with man's inclination to exalt<span id = line_243> [243] </span>
<br>
his own importance, strongly tended against the acceptance of such<span id = line_244> [244] </span>
<br>
heterodox views. Among the many hostile critics of the Copernican<span id = line_245> [245] </span>
<br>
system, Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) stands out pre-eminently. This<span id = line_246> [246] </span>
<br>
conscientious observer bitterly assailed Copernicus for his<span id = line_247> [247] </span>
<br>
suggestion that the earth moved, and developed a scheme of his own<span id = line_248> [248] </span>
<br>
which postulated that the planets revolved around the sun, and planets<span id = line_249> [249] </span>
<br>
and sun in turn revolved around the earth.<span id = line_250> [250] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_251> [251] </span>
<br>
The majority applauded Tycho; a small, very small group of insurgents<span id = line_252> [252] </span>
<br>
had faith in Copernicus. The illustrious Galileo (1564-1642)<span id = line_253> [253] </span>
<br>
belonged to the minority. The telescope of his invention unfolded<span id = line_254> [254] </span>
<br>
a view of the universe which belied the assertions of the many, and<span id = line_255> [255] </span>
<br>
strengthened his belief in the Copernican theory. "It (the Copernican<span id = line_256> [256] </span>
<br>
theory) explains to me the cause of many phenomena which under the<span id = line_257> [257] </span>
<br>
generally accepted theory are quite unintelligible. I have collected<span id = line_258> [258] </span>
<br>
arguments for refuting the latter, but I do not venture to bring<span id = line_259> [259] </span>
<br>
them to publication." So wrote Galileo to his friend, Kepler. "I do<span id = line_260> [260] </span>
<br>
not venture to bring them to publication." How significant of the<span id = line_261> [261] </span>
<br>
times--of any time, one ventures to add.<span id = line_262> [262] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_263> [263] </span>
<br>
Galileo did overcome his hesitancy and published his views. They<span id = line_264> [264] </span>
<br>
aroused a storm. "Look through my telescope," he pleaded. But the<span id = line_265> [265] </span>
<br>
professors would not; neither would the body of Inquisitors. The<span id = line_266> [266] </span>
<br>
Inquisition condemned him: "The proposition that the sun is in<span id = line_267> [267] </span>
<br>
the center of the earth and immovable from its place is absurd,<span id = line_268> [268] </span>
<br>
philosophically false and formally heretical; because it is expressly<span id = line_269> [269] </span>
<br>
contrary to the Holy Scriptures." And poor Galileo was made to utter<span id = line_270> [270] </span>
<br>
words which were as far removed from his thoughts as his oppressors'<span id = line_271> [271] </span>
<br>
ideas were from the truth: "I abjure, curse and detest the said errors<span id = line_272> [272] </span>
<br>
and heresies."<span id = line_273> [273] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_274> [274] </span>
<br>
The truth will out. Others arose who defied the majority and the<span id = line_275> [275] </span>
<br>
powerful Inquisition. Most prominent of all of these was Galileo's<span id = line_276> [276] </span>
<br>
friend, Kepler. Though a student of Tycho, Kepler did not hesitate to<span id = line_277> [277] </span>
<br>
espouse the Copernican system; but his adoption of it did not mean<span id = line_278> [278] </span>
<br>
unqualified approval. Kepler's criticism was particularly directed<span id = line_279> [279] </span>
<br>
against the Copernican theory that the planets revolve in circles. This<span id = line_280> [280] </span>
<br>
was boldness in the extreme. Ever since Aristotle's discourse on the<span id = line_281> [281] </span>
<br>
circle as a perfect figure, it was taken for granted that motion<span id = line_282> [282] </span>
<br>
in space was circular. Nature is perfect; the circle is perfect;<span id = line_283> [283] </span>
<br>
hence, if the sun revolves, it revolves in circles. So strongly<span id = line_284> [284] </span>
<br>
were men imbued with this "perfection," that Copernicus himself fell<span id = line_285> [285] </span>
<br>
victim. The sun no longer moved, but the earth and the planets did,<span id = line_286> [286] </span>
<br>
and they moved in a circle. Radical as Copernicus was, a few atoms<span id = line_287> [287] </span>
<br>
of conservatism remained with him still.<span id = line_288> [288] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_289> [289] </span>
<br>
Not so Kepler. Tycho had taught him the importance of careful<span id = line_290> [290] </span>
<br>
observation,--to such good effect, that Kepler came to the conclusion<span id = line_291> [291] </span>
<br>
that the revolution of the earth around the sun takes the form of an<span id = line_292> [292] </span>
<br>
ellipse rather than a circle, the sun being stationed at one of the<span id = line_293> [293] </span>
<br>
foci of the ellipse.<span id = line_294> [294] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_295> [295] </span>
<br>
To picture this ellipse, we shall ask the reader to stick two pins<span id = line_296> [296] </span>
<br>
a short distance apart into a piece of cardboard, and to place over<span id = line_297> [297] </span>
<br>
the pins a loop of string. With the point of a pencil draw the loop<span id = line_298> [298] </span>
<br>
taut. As the pencil moves around the two pins the curve so produced<span id = line_299> [299] </span>
<br>
will be an ellipse. The positions of the two pins represent the<span id = line_300> [300] </span>
<br>
two foci.<span id = line_301> [301] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_302> [302] </span>
<br>
Kepler's observation of the elliptical rotation of the planets was the<span id = line_303> [303] </span>
<br>
first of three laws, quantitatively expressed, which paved the way<span id = line_304> [304] </span>
<br>
for Newton's law. Why did the planets move in just this way? Kepler<span id = line_305> [305] </span>
<br>
tried to answer this also, but failed. It remained for Newton to<span id = line_306> [306] </span>
<br>
supply the answer to this question.<span id = line_307> [307] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_308> [308] </span>
<br>
Newton's Law of Gravitation. The Great Plague of 1666 drove Newton<span id = line_309> [309] </span>
<br>
from Cambridge to his home in Lincolnshire. There, according to the<span id = line_310> [310] </span>
<br>
celebrated legend, the philosopher sitting in his little garden one<span id = line_311> [311] </span>
<br>
fine afternoon, fell into a deep reverie. This was interrupted by the<span id = line_312> [312] </span>
<br>
fall of an apple, and the thinker turned his attention to the apple<span id = line_313> [313] </span>
<br>
and its fall.<span id = line_314> [314] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_315> [315] </span>
<br>
It must not be supposed that Newton "discovered" gravity. Apples<span id = line_316> [316] </span>
<br>
had been seen to fall before Newton's time, and the reason for their<span id = line_317> [317] </span>
<br>
return to earth was correctly attributed to this mysterious force of<span id = line_318> [318] </span>
<br>
attraction possessed by the earth, to which the name "gravity" had been<span id = line_319> [319] </span>
<br>
given. Newton's great triumph consisted in showing that this "gravity,"<span id = line_320> [320] </span>
<br>
which was supposed to be a peculiar property residing in the earth,<span id = line_321> [321] </span>
<br>
was a universal property of matter; that it applied to the moon and the<span id = line_322> [322] </span>
<br>
sun as well as to the earth; that, in fact, the motions of the moon<span id = line_323> [323] </span>
<br>
and the planets could be explained on the basis of gravitation. But<span id = line_324> [324] </span>
<br>
his supreme triumph was to give, in one sublime generalization,<span id = line_325> [325] </span>
<br>
quantitative expression to the motion regulating heavenly bodies.<span id = line_326> [326] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_327> [327] </span>
<br>
Let us follow Newton in his train of thought. An apple falls from a<span id = line_328> [328] </span>
<br>
tree 50 yards high. It would fall from a tree 500 yards high. It would<span id = line_329> [329] </span>
<br>
fall from the highest mountain top several miles above sea level. It<span id = line_330> [330] </span>
<br>
would probably fall from a height much above the mountain top. Why<span id = line_331> [331] </span>
<br>
not? Probably the further up you go the less does the earth attract<span id = line_332> [332] </span>
<br>
the apple, but at what distance does this attraction stop entirely?<span id = line_333> [333] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_334> [334] </span>
<br>
The nearest body in space to the earth is the moon, some 240,000 miles<span id = line_335> [335] </span>
<br>
away. Would an apple reach the earth if thrown from the moon? But<span id = line_336> [336] </span>
<br>
perhaps the moon itself has attractive power? If so, since the apple<span id = line_337> [337] </span>
<br>
would be much nearer the moon than the earth, the probabilities are<span id = line_338> [338] </span>
<br>
that the apple would never reach the earth.<span id = line_339> [339] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_340> [340] </span>
<br>
But hold! The apple is not the only object that falls to the<span id = line_341> [341] </span>
<br>
ground. What is true of the apple is true of all other bodies--of all<span id = line_342> [342] </span>
<br>
matter, large and small. Now there is the moon itself, a very large<span id = line_343> [343] </span>
<br>
body. Does the earth exert any gravitational pull on the moon? To<span id = line_344> [344] </span>
<br>
be sure, the moon is many thousands of miles away, but the moon is<span id = line_345> [345] </span>
<br>
a very large body, and perhaps this size is in some way related to<span id = line_346> [346] </span>
<br>
the power of attraction?<span id = line_347> [347] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_348> [348] </span>
<br>
But then if the earth attracts the moon, why does not the moon fall<span id = line_349> [349] </span>
<br>
to the earth?<span id = line_350> [350] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_351> [351] </span>
<br>
A glance at the accompanying figure will help to answer this<span id = line_352> [352] </span>
<br>
question. We must remember that the moon is not stationary, but<span id = line_353> [353] </span>
<br>
travelling at tremendous speed--so much so, that it circles the entire<span id = line_354> [354] </span>
<br>
earth every month. Now if the earth were absent the path of the moon<span id = line_355> [355] </span>
<br>
would be a straight line, say MB. If, however, the earth exerts<span id = line_356> [356] </span>
<br>
attraction, the moon would be pulled inward. Instead of following<span id = line_357> [357] </span>
<br>
the line MB it would follow the curved path MB'. And again, the moon<span id = line_358> [358] </span>
<br>
having arrived at B', is prevented from following the line B'C, but<span id = line_359> [359] </span>
<br>
rather B'C'. So that the path instead of being a straight line tends<span id = line_360> [360] </span>
<br>
to become curved. From Kepler's researches the probabilities were that<span id = line_361> [361] </span>
<br>
this curve would assume the shape of an ellipse rather than a circle.<span id = line_362> [362] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_363> [363] </span>
<br>
The only reason, then, why the moon does not fall to the earth is on<span id = line_364> [364] </span>
<br>
account of its motion. Were it to stop moving even for the fraction<span id = line_365> [365] </span>
<br>
of a second it would come straight down to us, and probably few would<span id = line_366> [366] </span>
<br>
live to tell the tale.<span id = line_367> [367] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_368> [368] </span>
<br>
Newton reasoned that what keeps the moon revolving around the earth is<span id = line_369> [369] </span>
<br>
the gravitational pull of the latter. The next important step was to<span id = line_370> [370] </span>
<br>
discover the law regulating this motion. Here Kepler's observations of<span id = line_371> [371] </span>
<br>
the movements of the planets around the sun was of inestimable value;<span id = line_372> [372] </span>
<br>
for from these Newton deduced the hypothesis that attraction varies<span id = line_373> [373] </span>
<br>
inversely as the square of the distance. Making use of this hypothesis,<span id = line_374> [374] </span>
<br>
Newton calculated what the attractive power possessed by the earth must<span id = line_375> [375] </span>
<br>
be in order that the moon may continue in its path. He next compared<span id = line_376> [376] </span>
<br>
this force with the force exerted by the earth in pulling the apple<span id = line_377> [377] </span>
<br>
to the ground, and found the forces to be identical! "I compared,"<span id = line_378> [378] </span>
<br>
he writes, "the force necessary to keep the moon in her orb with the<span id = line_379> [379] </span>
<br>
force of gravity at the surface of the earth, and found them answer<span id = line_380> [380] </span>
<br>
pretty nearly." One and the same force pulls the moon and pulls the<span id = line_381> [381] </span>
<br>
apple--the force of gravity. Further, the hypothesis that the force<span id = line_382> [382] </span>
<br>
of gravity varies inversely as the square of the distance had now<span id = line_383> [383] </span>
<br>
received experimental confirmation.<span id = line_384> [384] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_385> [385] </span>
<br>
The next step was perfectly clear. If the moon's motion is controlled<span id = line_386> [386] </span>
<br>
by the earth's gravitational pull, why is it not possible that the<span id = line_387> [387] </span>
<br>
earth's motion, in turn, is controlled by the sun's gravitational<span id = line_388> [388] </span>
<br>
pull? that, in fact, not only the earth's motion, but the motion of<span id = line_389> [389] </span>
<br>
all the planets is regulated by the same means?<span id = line_390> [390] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_391> [391] </span>
<br>
Here again Kepler's pioneer work was a foundation comparable to<span id = line_392> [392] </span>
<br>
reinforced concrete. Kepler, as we have seen, had shown that the earth<span id = line_393> [393] </span>
<br>
revolves around the sun in the form of an ellipse, one of the foci of<span id = line_394> [394] </span>
<br>
this ellipse being occupied by the sun. Newton now proved that such<span id = line_395> [395] </span>
<br>
an elliptic path was possible only if the intensity of the attractive<span id = line_396> [396] </span>
<br>
force between sun and planet varied inversely as the square of the<span id = line_397> [397] </span>
<br>
distance--the very same relationship that had been applied with such<span id = line_398> [398] </span>
<br>
success in explaining the motion of the moon around the earth!<span id = line_399> [399] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_400> [400] </span>
<br>
Newton showed that the moon, the sun, the planets--every body in space<span id = line_401> [401] </span>
<br>
conformed to this law. The earth attracts the moon; but so does the<span id = line_402> [402] </span>
<br>
moon the earth. If the moon revolves around the earth rather than the<span id = line_403> [403] </span>
<br>
earth around the moon, it is because the earth is a much larger body,<span id = line_404> [404] </span>
<br>
and hence its gravitational pull is stronger. The same is true of<span id = line_405> [405] </span>
<br>
the relationship existing between the earth and the sun.<span id = line_406> [406] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_407> [407] </span>
<br>
Further Developments of Newton's Law of Gravitation. When we speak of<span id = line_408> [408] </span>
<br>
the earth attracting the moon, and the moon the earth, what we really<span id = line_409> [409] </span>
<br>
mean is that every one of the myriad particles composing the earth<span id = line_410> [410] </span>
<br>
attracts every one of the myriad particles composing the moon, and<span id = line_411> [411] </span>
<br>
vice versa. If in dealing with the attractive forces existing between<span id = line_412> [412] </span>
<br>
a planet and its satellite, or a planet and the sun, the power exerted<span id = line_413> [413] </span>
<br>
by every one of these myriad particles would have to be considered<span id = line_414> [414] </span>
<br>
separately, then the mathematical task of computing such forces<span id = line_415> [415] </span>
<br>
might well appear hopeless. Newton was able to present the problem<span id = line_416> [416] </span>
<br>
in a very simple form by pointing out that in a sphere such as the<span id = line_417> [417] </span>
<br>
earth or the moon, the entire mass might be considered as residing<span id = line_418> [418] </span>
<br>
in the center of the sphere. For purposes of computation, the earth<span id = line_419> [419] </span>
<br>
can be considered a particle, with its entire mass concentrated at<span id = line_420> [420] </span>
<br>
the center of the particle. This viewpoint enabled Newton to extend<span id = line_421> [421] </span>
<br>
his law of inverse squares to the remotest bodies in the universe.<span id = line_422> [422] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_423> [423] </span>
<br>
If this great law of Newton's found such general application beyond our<span id = line_424> [424] </span>
<br>
planet, it served an equally useful purpose in explaining a number of<span id = line_425> [425] </span>
<br>
puzzling features on this planet. The ebb and flow of the tides was one<span id = line_426> [426] </span>
<br>
of these puzzles. Even in ancient times it had been noticed that a full<span id = line_427> [427] </span>
<br>
moon and a high tide went hand in hand, and various mysterious powers,<span id = line_428> [428] </span>
<br>
were attributed to the satellite and the ocean. Newton pointed out that<span id = line_429> [429] </span>
<br>
the height of the water was a direct consequence of the attractive<span id = line_430> [430] </span>
<br>
power of the moon, and, to a lesser extent, because further away,<span id = line_431> [431] </span>
<br>
of the sun.<span id = line_432> [432] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_433> [433] </span>
<br>
One of his first explanations, however, dealt with certain<span id = line_434> [434] </span>
<br>
irregularities in the moon's motion around the earth. If the solar<span id = line_435> [435] </span>
<br>
system would consist of the earth and moon alone, then the path of the<span id = line_436> [436] </span>
<br>
moon would be that of an ellipse, with one of the foci of this ellipse<span id = line_437> [437] </span>
<br>
occupied by the earth. Unfortunately for the simplicity of the problem,<span id = line_438> [438] </span>
<br>
there are other bodies relatively near in space, particularly that huge<span id = line_439> [439] </span>
<br>
body, the sun. The sun not only exerts its pull on the earth but also<span id = line_440> [440] </span>
<br>
on the moon. However, as the sun is much further away from the moon<span id = line_441> [441] </span>
<br>
than is the earth, the earth's attraction for its satellite is much<span id = line_442> [442] </span>
<br>
greater, despite the fact that the sun is much huger and weighs far<span id = line_443> [443] </span>
<br>
more than the earth. The greater pull of the earth in one direction,<span id = line_444> [444] </span>
<br>
and a lesser pull of the sun in another, places the poor moon between<span id = line_445> [445] </span>
<br>
the devil and the deep sea. The situation gives rise to a complexity of<span id = line_446> [446] </span>
<br>
forces, the net result of which is that the moon's orbit is not quite<span id = line_447> [447] </span>
<br>
that of an ellipse. Newton was able to account for all the forces that<span id = line_448> [448] </span>
<br>
come into play, and he proved that the actual path of the moon was<span id = line_449> [449] </span>
<br>
a direct consequence of the law of inverse squares in actual operation.<span id = line_450> [450] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_451> [451] </span>
<br>
The "Principia." The law of gravitation, embodying also laws of motion,<span id = line_452> [452] </span>
<br>
which we shall discuss presently, was first published in Newton's<span id = line_453> [453] </span>
<br>
immortal "Principia" (1686). A selection from the preface will disclose<span id = line_454> [454] </span>
<br>
the contents of the book, and, incidentally, the style of the author:<span id = line_455> [455] </span>
<br>
"... We offer this work as mathematical principles of philosophy; for<span id = line_456> [456] </span>
<br>
all the difficulty in philosophy seems to consist in this--from the<span id = line_457> [457] </span>
<br>
phenomena of motions to investigate the forces of nature, and then from<span id = line_458> [458] </span>
<br>
these forces to demonstrate the other phenomena; and to this end the<span id = line_459> [459] </span>
<br>
general propositions in the first and second book are directed. In the<span id = line_460> [460] </span>
<br>
third book we give an example of this in the explication of the system<span id = line_461> [461] </span>
<br>
of the world; for by the propositions mathematically demonstrated<span id = line_462> [462] </span>
<br>
in the first book, we there derive from the celestial phenomena the<span id = line_463> [463] </span>
<br>
forces of gravity with which bodies tend to the sun and the several<span id = line_464> [464] </span>
<br>
planets. Then, from these forces, by other propositions which are<span id = line_465> [465] </span>
<br>
also mathematical, we deduce the motions of the planets, the comets,<span id = line_466> [466] </span>
<br>
the moon and the sea. I wish we could derive the rest of the phenomena<span id = line_467> [467] </span>
<br>
of nature by the same kind of reasoning from mechanical principles;<span id = line_468> [468] </span>
<br>
for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that they may all depend<span id = line_469> [469] </span>
<br>
upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies, by some causes<span id = line_470> [470] </span>
<br>
hitherto unknown, are either mutually impelled towards each other,<span id = line_471> [471] </span>
<br>
and cohere in regular figures, or are repelled and recede from each<span id = line_472> [472] </span>
<br>
other...."<span id = line_473> [473] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_474> [474] </span>
<br>
At this point we may state that neither Newton, nor any of Newton's<span id = line_475> [475] </span>
<br>
successors including Einstein, have been able to advance even a<span id = line_476> [476] </span>
<br>
plausible theory as to the nature of this gravitational force. We<span id = line_477> [477] </span>
<br>
know that this force pulls a stone to the ground; we know, thanks<span id = line_478> [478] </span>
<br>
to Newton, the laws regulating the motions due to gravity; but what<span id = line_479> [479] </span>
<br>
this force we call gravity really is we do not know. The mystery is<span id = line_480> [480] </span>
<br>
as deep as the mystery of the origin of life.<span id = line_481> [481] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_482> [482] </span>
<br>
"Prof. Einstein," writes Prof. Eddington, "has sought, and has not<span id = line_483> [483] </span>
<br>
reached, any ultimate explanation of its [that is, gravitation]<span id = line_484> [484] </span>
<br>
cause. A certain connection between the gravitational field and the<span id = line_485> [485] </span>
<br>
measurement of space has been postulated, but this throws light rather<span id = line_486> [486] </span>
<br>
on the nature of our measurements than on gravitation itself. The<span id = line_487> [487] </span>
<br>
relativity theory is indifferent to hypotheses as to the nature of<span id = line_488> [488] </span>
<br>
gravitation, just as it is indifferent to hypotheses as to the nature<span id = line_489> [489] </span>
<br>
of light."<span id = line_490> [490] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_491> [491] </span>
<br>
Newton's Laws of Motion. In his Principia Newton begins with a series<span id = line_492> [492] </span>
<br>
of simple definitions dealing with matter and force, and these are<span id = line_493> [493] </span>
<br>
followed by his three famous laws of motion. The nature and amount<span id = line_494> [494] </span>
<br>
of the effort required to start a body moving, and the conditions<span id = line_495> [495] </span>
<br>
required to keep a body in motion, are included in these laws. The<span id = line_496> [496] </span>
<br>
Fundamentals, mass, time and space, are exhibited in their various<span id = line_497> [497] </span>
<br>
relationships. Of importance to us particularly is that in these laws,<span id = line_498> [498] </span>
<br>
time and space are considered as definite entities, and as two distinct<span id = line_499> [499] </span>
<br>
and widely separated manifestations. We shall see that in Einstein's<span id = line_500> [500] </span>
<br>
hands a very close relationship between these two is brought about.<span id = line_501> [501] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_502> [502] </span>
<br>
Both Newton and Einstein were led to their theory of gravitation<span id = line_503> [503] </span>
<br>
by profound studies of the mathematics of motion, but as Newton's<span id = line_504> [504] </span>
<br>
conception of motion differed from Einstein's, and as, moreover,<span id = line_505> [505] </span>
<br>
important discoveries into the nature of matter and the relationship<span id = line_506> [506] </span>
<br>
of motion to matter were made subsequent to Newton's time, we need not<span id = line_507> [507] </span>
<br>
wonder that the two theories show divergence; that, as we shall see,<span id = line_508> [508] </span>
<br>
Newton's is probably but an approximation of the truth. If we confine<span id = line_509> [509] </span>
<br>
our attention to our own solar system, the deviation from Newton's<span id = line_510> [510] </span>
<br>
law is, as a rule, so small as to be negligible.<span id = line_511> [511] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_512> [512] </span>
<br>
Newton's laws of motion are really axioms, like the axioms of Euclid:<span id = line_513> [513] </span>
<br>
they do not admit of direct proof; but there is this difference,<span id = line_514> [514] </span>
<br>
that the axioms of Euclid seem more obviously true. For example,<span id = line_515> [515] </span>
<br>
when Euclid informs us that "things which are equal to the same<span id = line_516> [516] </span>
<br>
thing are equal to one another," we have no hesitation in accepting<span id = line_517> [517] </span>
<br>
this statement, for it seems so self-evident. When, however, we are<span id = line_518> [518] </span>
<br>
told by Newton that "the alteration of motion is ever proportional<span id = line_519> [519] </span>
<br>
to the motive force impressed," we are at first somewhat bewildered<span id = line_520> [520] </span>
<br>
with the phraseology, and then, even when that has been mastered,<span id = line_521> [521] </span>
<br>
the readiness with which we respond will probably depend upon the<span id = line_522> [522] </span>
<br>
amount of scientific training we have received.<span id = line_523> [523] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_524> [524] </span>
<br>
"Every body continues in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a<span id = line_525> [525] </span>
<br>
straight line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces<span id = line_526> [526] </span>
<br>
impressed thereon." So runs Newton's first law of motion. A body does<span id = line_527> [527] </span>
<br>
not move unless something causes it to move; to make the body move<span id = line_528> [528] </span>
<br>
you must overcome the inertia of the body. On the other hand, if a<span id = line_529> [529] </span>
<br>
body is moving, it tends to continue moving, as witness our forward<span id = line_530> [530] </span>
<br>
movement when the train is brought to a standstill. It may be asked,<span id = line_531> [531] </span>
<br>
why does not a bullet continue moving indefinitely once it has left<span id = line_532> [532] </span>
<br>
the barrel of the gun? Because of the resistance of the air which it<span id = line_533> [533] </span>
<br>
has to overcome; and the path of the bullet is not straight because<span id = line_534> [534] </span>
<br>
gravity acts on it and tends to pull it downwards.<span id = line_535> [535] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_536> [536] </span>
<br>
We have no definite means of proving that a body once set in motion<span id = line_537> [537] </span>
<br>
would continue moving, for an indefinite time, and along a straight<span id = line_538> [538] </span>
<br>
line. What Newton meant was that a body would continue moving provided<span id = line_539> [539] </span>
<br>
no external force acted on it; but in actual practise such a condition<span id = line_540> [540] </span>
<br>
is unknown.<span id = line_541> [541] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_542> [542] </span>
<br>
Newton's first law defines force as that action necessary to change<span id = line_543> [543] </span>
<br>
a state of rest or of uniform motion, and tells us that force alone<span id = line_544> [544] </span>
<br>
changes the motion of a body. His second law deals with the relation<span id = line_545> [545] </span>
<br>
of the force applied and the resulting change of motion of the body;<span id = line_546> [546] </span>
<br>
that is, it shows us how force may be measured. "The alteration of<span id = line_547> [547] </span>
<br>
motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed, and is made<span id = line_548> [548] </span>
<br>
in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed."<span id = line_549> [549] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_550> [550] </span>
<br>
Newton's third law runs--"To every action there is always opposed<span id = line_551> [551] </span>
<br>
an equal reaction." The very fact that you have to use force means<span id = line_552> [552] </span>
<br>
that you have to overcome something of an opposite nature. The forward<span id = line_553> [553] </span>
<br>
pull of a horse towing a boat equals the backward pull of the tow-rope<span id = line_554> [554] </span>
<br>
connecting boat and horse. "Many people," says Prof. Watson, "find a<span id = line_555> [555] </span>
<br>
difficulty in accepting this statement ... since they think that if the<span id = line_556> [556] </span>
<br>
force exerted by the horse on the rope were not a little greater than<span id = line_557> [557] </span>
<br>
the backward force exerted by the rope on the horse, the boat would not<span id = line_558> [558] </span>
<br>
progress. In this case we must, however, remember that, as far as their<span id = line_559> [559] </span>
<br>
relative positions are concerned, the horse and the boat are at rest,<span id = line_560> [560] </span>
<br>
and form a single body, and the action and reaction between them, due<span id = line_561> [561] </span>
<br>
to the tension on the rope, must be equal and opposite, for otherwise<span id = line_562> [562] </span>
<br>
there would be relative motion, one with respect to the other."<span id = line_563> [563] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_564> [564] </span>
<br>
It may well be asked, what bearing have these laws of Newton on the<span id = line_565> [565] </span>
<br>
question of time and space? Simply this, that to measure force the<span id = line_566> [566] </span>
<br>
factors necessary are the masses of the bodies concerned, the time<span id = line_567> [567] </span>
<br>
involved and the space covered; and Newton's equations for measuring<span id = line_568> [568] </span>
<br>
forces assume time and space to be quite independent of one another. As<span id = line_569> [569] </span>
<br>
we shall see, this is in striking contrast to Einstein's view.<span id = line_570> [570] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_571> [571] </span>
<br>
Newton's Researches on Light. In 1665, when but 23 years old,<span id = line_572> [572] </span>
<br>
Newton invented the binomial theorem and the infinitesimal calculus,<span id = line_573> [573] </span>
<br>
two phases of pure mathematics which have been the cause of many a<span id = line_574> [574] </span>
<br>
sleepless night to college freshmen. Had Newton done nothing else his<span id = line_575> [575] </span>
<br>
fame would have been secure. But we have already glanced at his law<span id = line_576> [576] </span>
<br>
of inverse squares and the law of gravitation. We now have to turn<span id = line_577> [577] </span>
<br>
to some of Newton's contributions to optics, because here more than<span id = line_578> [578] </span>
<br>
elsewhere we shall find the starting point to a series of researches<span id = line_579> [579] </span>
<br>
which have culminated so brilliantly in the work of Einstein.<span id = line_580> [580] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_581> [581] </span>
<br>
Newton turned his attention to optics in 1666 when he proved that<span id = line_582> [582] </span>
<br>
the light from the sun, which appears white to us, is in reality a<span id = line_583> [583] </span>
<br>
mixture of all the colors of the rainbow. This he showed by placing<span id = line_584> [584] </span>
<br>
a prism between the ray of light and a screen. A spectrum showing<span id = line_585> [585] </span>
<br>
all the colors from red to violet appeared on the screen.<span id = line_586> [586] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_587> [587] </span>
<br>
Another notable achievement of his was the design of a telescope which<span id = line_588> [588] </span>
<br>
brought objects to a sharp focus and prevented the blurring effects<span id = line_589> [589] </span>
<br>
which had occasioned so much annoyance to Newton and his predecessors<span id = line_590> [590] </span>
<br>
in all their astronomical observations.<span id = line_591> [591] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_592> [592] </span>
<br>
These and other discoveries of very great interest were brought<span id = line_593> [593] </span>
<br>
together in a volume on optics which Newton published in 1704. Our<span id = line_594> [594] </span>
<br>
particular concern here is to examine the views advanced by him as<span id = line_595> [595] </span>
<br>
to the nature of light.<span id = line_596> [596] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_597> [597] </span>
<br>
That the nature of light should have been a subject for speculation<span id = line_598> [598] </span>
<br>
even to the ancients need not surprise us. If other senses, as<span id = line_599> [599] </span>
<br>
touch, for example, convey impressions of objects, it is true to say<span id = line_600> [600] </span>
<br>
that the sense of sight conveys the most complete impression. Our<span id = line_601> [601] </span>
<br>
conception of the external world is largely based upon the sense<span id = line_602> [602] </span>
<br>
of sight; particularly so when we deal with objects beyond our<span id = line_603> [603] </span>
<br>
reach. In astronomy, therefore, a study of the properties of light<span id = line_604> [604] </span>
<br>
is indispensable. [1]<span id = line_605> [605] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_606> [606] </span>
<br>
But what is this light? We open our eyes and we see; we close our eyes<span id = line_607> [607] </span>
<br>
and we fail to see. At night in a dark room we may have our eyes open<span id = line_608> [608] </span>
<br>
and yet we do not see; light, then, must be absent. Evidently, light<span id = line_609> [609] </span>
<br>
does not wholly depend upon whether our eyes are open or closed. This<span id = line_610> [610] </span>
<br>
much is certain: the eye functions and something else functions. What<span id = line_611> [611] </span>
<br>
is this "something else"?<span id = line_612> [612] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_613> [613] </span>
<br>
Strangely enough, Plato and Aristotle regarded light as a property of<span id = line_614> [614] </span>
<br>
the eye and the eye alone. Out of the eye tentacles were shot which<span id = line_615> [615] </span>
<br>
intercepted the object and so illuminated it. From what has already<span id = line_616> [616] </span>
<br>
been said, such a view seems highly unlikely. Far more consistent with<span id = line_617> [617] </span>
<br>
their philosophy in other directions would have been the theory that<span id = line_618> [618] </span>
<br>
light has its source in the object and not in the eye, and travels<span id = line_619> [619] </span>
<br>
from object to eye rather than the reverse. How little substance the<span id = line_620> [620] </span>
<br>
Aristotelian contribution possesses is immediately seen when we refer<span id = line_621> [621] </span>
<br>
to the art of photography. Here light rays produce effects which are<span id = line_622> [622] </span>
<br>
independent of any property of the eye. The blind man may click the<span id = line_623> [623] </span>
<br>
camera and produce the impression on the plate.<span id = line_624> [624] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_625> [625] </span>
<br>
Newton, of course, could have fallen into no such error as did Plato<span id = line_626> [626] </span>
<br>
and Aristotle. The source of light to him was the luminous body. Such<span id = line_627> [627] </span>
<br>
a body had the power of emitting minute particles at great speed,<span id = line_628> [628] </span>
<br>
and these when coming in contact with the retina produce the sensation<span id = line_629> [629] </span>
<br>
of sight.<span id = line_630> [630] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_631> [631] </span>
<br>
This emission or corpuscular theory of Newton's was combated<span id = line_632> [632] </span>
<br>
very strongly by his illustrious Dutch contemporary, Huyghens, who<span id = line_633> [633] </span>
<br>
maintained that light was a wave phenomenon, the disturbance starting<span id = line_634> [634] </span>
<br>
at the luminous body and spreading out in all directions. The wave<span id = line_635> [635] </span>
<br>
motions of the sea offer a certain analogy.<span id = line_636> [636] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_637> [637] </span>
<br>
Newton's strongest objection to Huyghens' wave theory was that it<span id = line_638> [638] </span>
<br>
seemed to offer no satisfactory explanation as to why light travelled<span id = line_639> [639] </span>
<br>
in straight lines. He says: "To me the fundamental supposition itself<span id = line_640> [640] </span>
<br>
seems impossible, namely that the waves or vibrations of any fluid can,<span id = line_641> [641] </span>
<br>
like the rays of light, be propagated in straight lines, without a<span id = line_642> [642] </span>
<br>
continual and very extravagant bending and spreading every way into<span id = line_643> [643] </span>
<br>
the quiescent medium, where they are terminated by it. I mistake if<span id = line_644> [644] </span>
<br>
there be not both experiment and demonstration to the contrary."<span id = line_645> [645] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_646> [646] </span>
<br>
In the corpuscular theory the particles emitted by the luminous<span id = line_647> [647] </span>
<br>
body were supposed to travel in straight lines. In empty space the<span id = line_648> [648] </span>
<br>
particles travelled in straight lines and spread in all directions. To<span id = line_649> [649] </span>
<br>
explain how light could traverse some types of matter--liquids, for<span id = line_650> [650] </span>
<br>
example--Newton supposed that these light particles travelled in the<span id = line_651> [651] </span>
<br>
spaces between the molecules of the liquid.<span id = line_652> [652] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_653> [653] </span>
<br>
Newton's objection to the wave theory was not answered very<span id = line_654> [654] </span>
<br>
convincingly by Huyghens. Today we know that light waves of high<span id = line_655> [655] </span>
<br>
frequency tend to travel in straight lines, but may be prevented from<span id = line_656> [656] </span>
<br>
doing so by gravitational forces of bodies near its path. But this<span id = line_657> [657] </span>
<br>
is Einstein's discovery.<span id = line_658> [658] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_659> [659] </span>
<br>
A very famous experiment by Foucault in 1853 proved beyond the shadow<span id = line_660> [660] </span>
<br>
of a doubt that Newton's corpuscular theory was untenable. According<span id = line_661> [661] </span>
<br>
to Newton's theory, the velocity of light must be greater in a denser<span id = line_662> [662] </span>
<br>
medium (such as water) than in a lighter one (such as air). According<span id = line_663> [663] </span>
<br>
to the wave theory the reverse is true. Foucault showed that light<span id = line_664> [664] </span>
<br>
does travel more slowly in water than in air. The facts were against<span id = line_665> [665] </span>
<br>
Newton and in favor of Huyghens; and where facts and theory clash<span id = line_666> [666] </span>
<br>
there is but one thing to do: discard the theory.<span id = line_667> [667] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_668> [668] </span>
<br>
Some Facts about Newton. Newton was a Cambridge man, and Newton made<span id = line_669> [669] </span>
<br>
Cambridge famous as a mathematical center. Since Newton's day Cambridge<span id = line_670> [670] </span>
<br>
has boasted of a Clerk Maxwell and a Rayleigh, and her Larmor, her<span id = line_671> [671] </span>
<br>
J. J. Thomson and her Rutherford are still with us. Newton entered<span id = line_672> [672] </span>
<br>
Trinity College when he was 18 and soon threw himself into higher<span id = line_673> [673] </span>
<br>
mathematics. In 1669, when but 27 years old, he became professor of<span id = line_674> [674] </span>
<br>
mathematics at Cambridge, and later represented that seat of learning<span id = line_675> [675] </span>
<br>
in Parliament. When his friend Montague became Chancellor of the<span id = line_676> [676] </span>
<br>
Exchequer, Newton was offered, and accepted, the lucrative position<span id = line_677> [677] </span>
<br>
of Master of the Mint. As president of the Royal Society Newton was<span id = line_678> [678] </span>
<br>
occasionally brought in contact with Queen Anne. She held Newton in<span id = line_679> [679] </span>
<br>
high esteem, and in 1705 she conferred the honor of knighthood on<span id = line_680> [680] </span>
<br>
him. He died in 1727.<span id = line_681> [681] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_682> [682] </span>
<br>
"I do not know," wrote Newton, "what I may appear to the world,<span id = line_683> [683] </span>
<br>
but, to myself, I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the<span id = line_684> [684] </span>
<br>
seashore, and directing myself in now and then finding a smoother<span id = line_685> [685] </span>
<br>
pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of<span id = line_686> [686] </span>
<br>
truth lay all undiscovered before me."<span id = line_687> [687] </span>

THE ETHER AND ITS CONSEQUENCES<span id = line_712> [712] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_713> [713] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_714> [714] </span>
<br>
Huyghens' wave theory of light, now so generally accepted, loses its<span id = line_715> [715] </span>
<br>
entire significance if a medium for the propagation of these waves<span id = line_716> [716] </span>
<br>
is left out of consideration. This medium we call the ether. [2]<span id = line_717> [717] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_718> [718] </span>
<br>
Huyghens' reasoning may be illustrated in some such way as this:<span id = line_719> [719] </span>
<br>
If a body moves a force pushes or pulls it. That force itself is<span id = line_720> [720] </span>
<br>
exemplified in some kind of matter--say a horse. The horse in pulling<span id = line_721> [721] </span>
<br>
a cart is attached to the cart. The horse in pulling a boat may not be<span id = line_722> [722] </span>
<br>
attached to the boat directly but to a rope, which in turn is attached<span id = line_723> [723] </span>
<br>
to the boat. In common cases where one piece of matter affects another,<span id = line_724> [724] </span>
<br>
there is some direct contact, some go-between.<span id = line_725> [725] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_726> [726] </span>
<br>
But cases are known where matter affects matter without affording us<span id = line_727> [727] </span>
<br>
any evidence of contact. Take the case of a magnet's attraction for<span id = line_728> [728] </span>
<br>
a piece of iron. Where is the rope that pulls the iron towards the<span id = line_729> [729] </span>
<br>
magnet? Perhaps you think the attraction due to the air in between the<span id = line_730> [730] </span>
<br>
magnet and iron? But removing the air does not stop the attraction. Yet<span id = line_731> [731] </span>
<br>
how can we conceive of the iron being drawn to the magnet unless there<span id = line_732> [732] </span>
<br>
is some go-between? some medium not readily perceptible to the senses<span id = line_733> [733] </span>
<br>
perhaps, and therefore not strictly a form of matter?<span id = line_734> [734] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_735> [735] </span>
<br>
If we can but picture some such medium we can imagine our magnet<span id = line_736> [736] </span>
<br>
giving rise to vibrations in this medium which are carried to the<span id = line_737> [737] </span>
<br>
iron. The magnet may give rise to a disturbance in that portion of the<span id = line_738> [738] </span>
<br>
medium nearest to it; then this portion hands over the disturbance<span id = line_739> [739] </span>
<br>
to its neighbor, the next portion of the medium; and so on, until<span id = line_740> [740] </span>
<br>
the disturbance reaches the iron. You see, we are satisfying our<span id = line_741> [741] </span>
<br>
sense-perception by arguing in favor of action by actual contact<span id = line_742> [742] </span>
<br>
rather than some vague action at a distance; the go-between instead<span id = line_743> [743] </span>
<br>
of being a rope is the medium called the ether.<span id = line_744> [744] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_745> [745] </span>
<br>
Foucault's experiment completely shattered the corpuscular theory<span id = line_746> [746] </span>
<br>
of light, and for want of any other more plausible alternative, we<span id = line_747> [747] </span>
<br>
are thrown back on Huyghens' wave theory. It will presently appear<span id = line_748> [748] </span>
<br>
that this wave theory has elements in it which make it an excellent<span id = line_749> [749] </span>
<br>
alternative. In the meantime, if light is to be considered as a wave<span id = line_750> [750] </span>
<br>
motion, then the query immediately arises, what is the medium through<span id = line_751> [751] </span>
<br>
which these waves are propagated? If water is the medium for the waves<span id = line_752> [752] </span>
<br>
of the sea, what is the medium for the waves of light? Again we answer,<span id = line_753> [753] </span>
<br>
the medium is the ether.<span id = line_754> [754] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_755> [755] </span>
<br>
What Is This "Ether"? Balloonists find conditions more and more<span id = line_756> [756] </span>
<br>
uncomfortable the higher they ascend, for the density of the air<span id = line_757> [757] </span>
<br>
(and therefore the amount of oxygen in a given volume of air) becomes<span id = line_758> [758] </span>
<br>
less and less. Meteorologists have calculated that traces of the<span id = line_759> [759] </span>
<br>
air we breathe may reach a height of some 200 miles. But what is<span id = line_760> [760] </span>
<br>
beyond? Nothing but the ether, it is claimed. Light from the sun and<span id = line_761> [761] </span>
<br>
stars reaches us via the ether.<span id = line_762> [762] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_763> [763] </span>
<br>
But what is this ether? We cannot handle it. We cannot see it. It<span id = line_764> [764] </span>
<br>
fails to fall within the scope of any of our senses, for every attempt<span id = line_765> [765] </span>
<br>
to show its presence has failed. It is spirit-like in the popular<span id = line_766> [766] </span>
<br>
sense. It is Lodge's medium for the souls of the departed.<span id = line_767> [767] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_768> [768] </span>
<br>
Helmholtz and Kelvin tried to arrive at some properties of this<span id = line_769> [769] </span>
<br>
hypothetical substance from a careful study of the manner in<span id = line_770> [770] </span>
<br>
which waves were propagated through this ether. If, as the wave<span id = line_771> [771] </span>
<br>
theory teaches us, the ether can be set in motion, then according<span id = line_772> [772] </span>
<br>
to laws of mechanics, the ether has mass. If so it is smaller in<span id = line_773> [773] </span>
<br>
amount than anything which can be detected with our most accurate<span id = line_774> [774] </span>
<br>
balance. Further--and this is a difficulty not easily explained--if<span id = line_775> [775] </span>
<br>
this ether has any mass, why does it offer no detectable resistance<span id = line_776> [776] </span>
<br>
to the velocity of the planets in it? Why is not the velocity of<span id = line_777> [777] </span>
<br>
the planets reduced in time, just as the velocity of a rifle bullet<span id = line_778> [778] </span>
<br>
decreases owing to the resistance of the air?<span id = line_779> [779] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_780> [780] </span>
<br>
Lodge, in arguing in favor of an ether, holds that its presence cannot<span id = line_781> [781] </span>
<br>
be detected because it pervades all space and all matter. His favorite<span id = line_782> [782] </span>
<br>
analogy is to point out the extreme unlikelihood of a deep-sea fish<span id = line_783> [783] </span>
<br>
discovering the presence of the water with which it is surrounded on<span id = line_784> [784] </span>
<br>
all sides;--all of which tells us nothing about the ether, but does<span id = line_785> [785] </span>
<br>
try to tell us why we cannot detect it. [3]<span id = line_786> [786] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_787> [787] </span>
<br>
In short, answering the query at the head of this paragraph, we may<span id = line_788> [788] </span>
<br>
say that we do not know.<span id = line_789> [789] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_790> [790] </span>
<br>
Waves Set up in This Ether. The waves are not all of the same<span id = line_791> [791] </span>
<br>
length. Those that produce the sensation of sight are not the smallest<span id = line_792> [792] </span>
<br>
waves known, yet their length is so small that it would take anywhere<span id = line_793> [793] </span>
<br>
from one to two million of them to cover a yard. Curiously enough,<span id = line_794> [794] </span>
<br>
our eye is not sensitive to wave lengths beyond either side of these<span id = line_795> [795] </span>
<br>
limits; yet much smaller, and much larger waves are known. The smallest<span id = line_796> [796] </span>
<br>
are the famous X-rays, which are scarcely one ten-thousandth the size<span id = line_797> [797] </span>
<br>
of light waves. Waves which have a powerful chemical action--those<span id = line_798> [798] </span>
<br>
which act on a photographic plate, for example--are longer than<span id = line_799> [799] </span>
<br>
X-rays, yet smaller than light waves. Waves larger than light waves<span id = line_800> [800] </span>
<br>
are those which produce the sensation of heat, and those used in<span id = line_801> [801] </span>
<br>
wireless telegraphy. The latter may reach the enormous length of 5,000<span id = line_802> [802] </span>
<br>
yards. X-ray, actinic, or chemically active ray, light ray, heat ray,<span id = line_803> [803] </span>
<br>
wireless ray--they differ in size, yet they all have this in common:<span id = line_804> [804] </span>
<br>
they travel with the same speed (186,000 miles per second).<span id = line_805> [805] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_806> [806] </span>
<br>
The Electromagnetic Theory of Light. Powerful support to the conception<span id = line_807> [807] </span>
<br>
that space is pervaded by ether was given when Maxwell discovered<span id = line_808> [808] </span>
<br>
light to be an electromagnetic phenomenon. From purely theoretical<span id = line_809> [809] </span>
<br>
considerations this gifted English physicist was led to the view<span id = line_810> [810] </span>
<br>
that waves could be set up as a result of electrical disturbances. He<span id = line_811> [811] </span>
<br>
proved that such waves would travel with the same velocity as light<span id = line_812> [812] </span>
<br>
waves. As air is not needed to transmit electrical phenomena--for you<span id = line_813> [813] </span>
<br>
can pump all air out of a system and produce a vacuum, and electrical<span id = line_814> [814] </span>
<br>
phenomena will continue--Maxwell was forced to the conclusion that<span id = line_815> [815] </span>
<br>
the waves set up by electrical disturbances and transmitted with the<span id = line_816> [816] </span>
<br>
same velocity as light, were enabled to do so with the help of the<span id = line_817> [817] </span>
<br>
same medium as light, namely, the ether.<span id = line_818> [818] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_819> [819] </span>
<br>
It was now but a step for Maxwell to formulate the theory that light<span id = line_820> [820] </span>
<br>
itself is nothing but an electrical phenomenon, the sensation of light<span id = line_821> [821] </span>
<br>
being due to the passage of electric waves through the ether. This<span id = line_822> [822] </span>
<br>
theory met with considerable opposition at first. Physicists had been<span id = line_823> [823] </span>
<br>
brought up in a school which had taught that light and electricity<span id = line_824> [824] </span>
<br>
were two entirely unrelated phenomena, and it was difficult for<span id = line_825> [825] </span>
<br>
them to loosen the shackles that bound them to the older school. But<span id = line_826> [826] </span>
<br>
two startling discoveries helped to fasten attention upon Maxwell's<span id = line_827> [827] </span>
<br>
theory. One was an experimental confirmation of Maxwell's theoretical<span id = line_828> [828] </span>
<br>
deduction. Hertz, a pupil of Helmholtz, showed how the discharge from<span id = line_829> [829] </span>
<br>
a Leyden jar set up oscillations, which in turn gave rise to waves in<span id = line_830> [830] </span>
<br>
the ether, comparable, in so far as velocity is concerned, to light<span id = line_831> [831] </span>
<br>
waves, but differing from the latter in wave length, the Hertzian<span id = line_832> [832] </span>
<br>
waves being much longer. At a later date these waves were further<span id = line_833> [833] </span>
<br>
investigated by Marconi, with the result that wireless messages soon<span id = line_834> [834] </span>
<br>
began to be flashed from one place to another.<span id = line_835> [835] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_836> [836] </span>
<br>
Just as there is a close connection between light and electricity,<span id = line_837> [837] </span>
<br>
so there is between light and magnetism. The first to point out such<span id = line_838> [838] </span>
<br>
a relationship was the illustrious Michael Faraday, but we owe to<span id = line_839> [839] </span>
<br>
Zeeman the most extensive investigations in this field.<span id = line_840> [840] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_841> [841] </span>
<br>
If we throw some common salt into a flame, and, with the help of a<span id = line_842> [842] </span>
<br>
spectroscope, examine the spectrum produced, we are struck by two<span id = line_843> [843] </span>
<br>
bright lines which stand out very prominently. These lines, yellow<span id = line_844> [844] </span>
<br>
in color, are known as the D-lines and serve to identify even minute<span id = line_845> [845] </span>
<br>
traces of sodium. What is true of sodium is true of other elements:<span id = line_846> [846] </span>
<br>
they all produce very characteristic spectra. Now Zeeman found that if<span id = line_847> [847] </span>
<br>
the flame is placed between a powerful magnet, and then some common<span id = line_848> [848] </span>
<br>
salt thrown into the flame, the two yellow lines give place to ten<span id = line_849> [849] </span>
<br>
yellow lines. Such is one of the results of the effect of a magnetic<span id = line_850> [850] </span>
<br>
field on light.<span id = line_851> [851] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_852> [852] </span>
<br>
The Electron. The "Zeeman effect" led to several theories regarding<span id = line_853> [853] </span>
<br>
its nature. The most successful of these was one proposed by Larmor and<span id = line_854> [854] </span>
<br>
more fully treated by Lorentz. It has already been pointed out that the<span id = line_855> [855] </span>
<br>
only difference between wireless and light waves is that the former<span id = line_856> [856] </span>
<br>
are much "longer," and, we may now add, their vibrations are much<span id = line_857> [857] </span>
<br>
slower. Light and wireless waves bear a relationship to one another<span id = line_858> [858] </span>
<br>
comparable to the relationship born by high and low-pitched sounds. To<span id = line_859> [859] </span>
<br>
produce wireless waves we allow a charge of electricity to oscillate<span id = line_860> [860] </span>
<br>
to and fro. These oscillations, or oscillating charges, are the cause<span id = line_861> [861] </span>
<br>
of such waves. What charges give rise to light waves? Lorentz, from<span id = line_862> [862] </span>
<br>
a study of the Zeeman effect, ascribed them to minute particles of<span id = line_863> [863] </span>
<br>
matter, smaller than the chemical atom, to which the name "electron"<span id = line_864> [864] </span>
<br>
was given.<span id = line_865> [865] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_866> [866] </span>
<br>
The unit of electricity is the electron. Electrons in motion give rise<span id = line_867> [867] </span>
<br>
to electricity, and electrons in vibration, to light. The Zeeman effect<span id = line_868> [868] </span>
<br>
gave Lorentz enough data to calculate the mass of such electrons. He<span id = line_869> [869] </span>
<br>
then showed that these electrons in a magnetic field would be disturbed<span id = line_870> [870] </span>
<br>
by precisely the amount to which Zeeman's observations pointed. In<span id = line_871> [871] </span>
<br>
other words, the assumption of the electron fitted in most admirably<span id = line_872> [872] </span>
<br>
with Zeeman's experiments on magnetism and light.<span id = line_873> [873] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_874> [874] </span>
<br>
In the meantime, a study of the discharge of electricity through<span id = line_875> [875] </span>
<br>
gases, and, later, the discovery of radium, led, among other things,<span id = line_876> [876] </span>
<br>
to a study of beta or cathode rays--negatively charged particles<span id = line_877> [877] </span>
<br>
of electricity. Through a series of strikingly original experiments<span id = line_878> [878] </span>
<br>
J. J. Thomson ascertained the mass of such particles or corpuscles, and<span id = line_879> [879] </span>
<br>
then the very striking fact was brought out that Thomson's corpuscle<span id = line_880> [880] </span>
<br>
weighed the same as Lorentz's electron. The electron was not merely<span id = line_881> [881] </span>
<br>
the unit of electricity but the smallest particle of matter.<span id = line_882> [882] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_883> [883] </span>
<br>
The Nature of Matter. All matter is made up of some eighty-odd<span id = line_884> [884] </span>
<br>
elements. Oxygen, copper, lead are examples of such elements. Each<span id = line_885> [885] </span>
<br>
element in turn consists of an innumerable number of atoms, of a size<span id = line_886> [886] </span>
<br>
so small, that 300 million of them could be placed alongside of one<span id = line_887> [887] </span>
<br>
another without their total length exceeding one inch.<span id = line_888> [888] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_889> [889] </span>
<br>
John Dalton more than a hundred years ago postulated a theory, now<span id = line_890> [890] </span>
<br>
known as the atomic theory, to explain one of the fundamental laws<span id = line_891> [891] </span>
<br>
in chemistry. This theory started out with an old Greek assumption<span id = line_892> [892] </span>
<br>
that matter cannot be divided indefinitely, but that, by continued<span id = line_893> [893] </span>
<br>
subdivision, a point would be reached beyond which no further breaking<span id = line_894> [894] </span>
<br>
up would be possible. The particles at this stage Dalton called atoms.<span id = line_895> [895] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_896> [896] </span>
<br>
Dalton's atomic hypothesis became one of the pillars upon which the<span id = line_897> [897] </span>
<br>
whole superstructure of chemistry rested, and this because it explained<span id = line_898> [898] </span>
<br>
a number of perplexing difficulties so much more satisfactorily than<span id = line_899> [899] </span>
<br>
any other hypothesis.<span id = line_900> [900] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_901> [901] </span>
<br>
For nearly a century Dalton stood as firm as a rock. But early<span id = line_902> [902] </span>
<br>
in the nineties some epoch-making experiments on the discharge<span id = line_903> [903] </span>
<br>
of electricity through gases were begun by a group of physicists,<span id = line_904> [904] </span>
<br>
particularly Crookes, Rutherford, Lenard, Roentgen, Becquerel, and,<span id = line_905> [905] </span>
<br>
above all, J. J. Thomson, which pointed very clearly to the fact that<span id = line_906> [906] </span>
<br>
the atoms are not the smallest particles of matter at all; that,<span id = line_907> [907] </span>
<br>
in fact, they could be broken up into electrons, of a diameter one<span id = line_908> [908] </span>
<br>
one-hundred-thousandth that of an atom.<span id = line_909> [909] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_910> [910] </span>
<br>
It remained for the illustrious Madame Curie to confirm this beyond<span id = line_911> [911] </span>
<br>
all doubt by her isolation of radium. Here, as Madame Curie showed,<span id = line_912> [912] </span>
<br>
was an element whose atoms were actually breaking up under one's very<span id = line_913> [913] </span>
<br>
eyes, so to speak.<span id = line_914> [914] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_915> [915] </span>
<br>
So far have we advanced since Dalton's day, that Dalton's unit,<span id = line_916> [916] </span>
<br>
the atom, is now pictured as a complex particle patterned after our<span id = line_917> [917] </span>
<br>
solar system, with a nucleus of positive electricity in the center,<span id = line_918> [918] </span>
<br>
and particles of negative electricity, or electrons, surrounding<span id = line_919> [919] </span>
<br>
the nucleus.<span id = line_920> [920] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_921> [921] </span>
<br>
All this leads to one inevitable conclusion: matter is electrical in<span id = line_922> [922] </span>
<br>
nature. But now if matter and light have the same origin, and matter<span id = line_923> [923] </span>
<br>
is subject to gravitation, why not light also? So reasoned Einstein.<span id = line_924> [924] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_925> [925] </span>
<br>
Summary. Newton's studies of matter in motion led to his theory of<span id = line_926> [926] </span>
<br>
gravitation, and, incidentally, to his conception of time and space<span id = line_927> [927] </span>
<br>
as definite entities. As we shall see, Einstein in his theory of<span id = line_928> [928] </span>
<br>
gravitation based it upon discoveries belonging to the post-Newtonian<span id = line_929> [929] </span>
<br>
period. One of these is Minkowski's theory of time and space as one<span id = line_930> [930] </span>
<br>
and inseparable. This theory we shall discuss at some length in the<span id = line_931> [931] </span>
<br>
next chapter.<span id = line_932> [932] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_933> [933] </span>
<br>
Other important discoveries which led up to Einstein's work are the<span id = line_934> [934] </span>
<br>
researches which culminated in the electron theory of matter. The<span id = line_935> [935] </span>
<br>
origin of this theory may be traced to studies dealing with the nature<span id = line_936> [936] </span>
<br>
of light.<span id = line_937> [937] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_938> [938] </span>
<br>
Here again Newton appears as a pioneer. Newton's corpuscular theory,<span id = line_939> [939] </span>
<br>
however, proved wholly untenable when Foucault showed that the<span id = line_940> [940] </span>
<br>
velocity of light in water is less than in air, which is the very<span id = line_941> [941] </span>
<br>
reverse of what the corpuscular theory demands, but which does agree<span id = line_942> [942] </span>
<br>
with Huyghens' wave theory.<span id = line_943> [943] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_944> [944] </span>
<br>
But Huyghens' wave theory postulated some medium in which the waves<span id = line_945> [945] </span>
<br>
can act. To this medium the name "ether" was given. However, all<span id = line_946> [946] </span>
<br>
attempts to show the presence of such an ether failed. Naturally<span id = line_947> [947] </span>
<br>
enough, some began to doubt the existence of an ether altogether.<span id = line_948> [948] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_949> [949] </span>
<br>
Huyghens' wave theory received a new lease of life with Maxwell's<span id = line_950> [950] </span>
<br>
discovery that light is an electromagnetic phenomenon; that the waves<span id = line_951> [951] </span>
<br>
set up by a source of light were comparable to waves set up by an<span id = line_952> [952] </span>
<br>
electrical disturbance.<span id = line_953> [953] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_954> [954] </span>
<br>
Zeeman next showed that magnetism was also, closely related to light.<span id = line_955> [955] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_956> [956] </span>
<br>
A study of Zeeman's experiments led Lorentz to the conclusion that<span id = line_957> [957] </span>
<br>
electrical phenomena are due to the motion of charged particles called<span id = line_958> [958] </span>
<br>
"electrons," and that the vibrations of these electrons give rise<span id = line_959> [959] </span>
<br>
to light.<span id = line_960> [960] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_961> [961] </span>
<br>
The conception of the electron as the very fundamental of matter was<span id = line_962> [962] </span>
<br>
arrived at in an entirely different way: from studies dealing with<span id = line_963> [963] </span>
<br>
the discharge of electricity through gases and the breaking up of<span id = line_964> [964] </span>
<br>
the atoms of radium.<span id = line_965> [965] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_966> [966] </span>
<br>
If matter and light have the same origin, and if matter is subject<span id = line_967> [967] </span>
<br>
to gravitation, why not light also?<span id = line_968> [968] </span>

What has this Albert Einstein done to merit such extraordinary<span id = line_1012> [1012] </span>
<br>
praise? With the world in turmoil, with classes and races in a death<span id = line_1013> [1013] </span>
<br>
struggle, with millions suffering and starving, why do we find time<span id = line_1014> [1014] </span>

to turn our attention to this Jew? His ideas have no bearing on<span id = line_1015> [1015] </span>

<br>
populations.<span id = line_1017> [1017] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1018> [1018] </span>
<br>
The answer is not hard to find. Men come and men go, but the mystery of<span id = line_1019> [1019] </span>
<br>
the universe remains. It is Einstein's glory to have given us a deeper<span id = line_1020> [1020] </span>
<br>
insight into the universe. Our scientists are Huxley's agnostics:<span id = line_1021> [1021] </span>
<br>
they do not deny activities beyond our planet; they merely center<span id = line_1022> [1022] </span>
<br>
their attention on the knowable on this earth. Our philosophers,<span id = line_1023> [1023] </span>
<br>
on the other hand, go far afield. Some of them soar so high that,<span id = line_1024> [1024] </span>
<br>
like one poet's opinion of Shelley, the bubble bursts. Einstein,<span id = line_1025> [1025] </span>
<br>
using the tools of the scientist--the experimentalist--builded a<span id = line_1026> [1026] </span>
<br>
skyscraper which ultimately reached the philosophical school. His rôle<span id = line_1027> [1027] </span>
<br>
is the rôle of alcohol in causing water and ether (the anæsthetic)<span id = line_1028> [1028] </span>
<br>
to mix. Ether and water will mix no better than oil and water, without<span id = line_1029> [1029] </span>
<br>
the presence of alcohol; in its presence a uniform mixture is obtained.<span id = line_1030> [1030] </span>

<span id = line_1031> [1031] </span>
<br>
The Object of the Eclipse Expedition. Einstein prophesied that a<span id = line_1032> [1032] </span>
<br>
ray of light passing near the sun would be pulled out of its course,<span id = line_1033> [1033] </span>
<br>
due to the action of gravity. He went even further. He predicted how<span id = line_1034> [1034] </span>
<br>
much out of its course the ray would be deflected. This prediction<span id = line_1035> [1035] </span>
<br>
was based on a theory of gravitation which Einstein had developed in<span id = line_1036> [1036] </span>
<br>
great mathematical detail. The object of the British Eclipse Expedition<span id = line_1037> [1037] </span>
<br>
was either to prove or disprove Einstein's assumption.<span id = line_1038> [1038] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1039> [1039] </span>
<br>
The Result of the Expedition. Einstein's prophecy was fulfilled almost<span id = line_1040> [1040] </span>
<br>
to the letter.<span id = line_1041> [1041] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1042> [1042] </span>
<br>
The Significance of the Result. Since Einstein's theory of gravitation<span id = line_1043> [1043] </span>
<br>
is intimately associated with certain revolutionary ideas concerning<span id = line_1044> [1044] </span>
<br>
time and space, and, therefore, with Fundamentals of the Universe,<span id = line_1045> [1045] </span>
<br>
the net result of the expedition was to strengthen our belief in the<span id = line_1046> [1046] </span>
<br>
validity of his new view of the universe.<span id = line_1047> [1047] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1048> [1048] </span>
<br>
It is our intention in the following pages to discuss the expedition<span id = line_1049> [1049] </span>
<br>
and the larger aspects of Einstein's theory that follow from it. But<span id = line_1050> [1050] </span>
<br>
before we do so we must have a clear idea of our solar system.<span id = line_1051> [1051] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1052> [1052] </span>
<br>
Our Solar System. In the center of our system is the sun, a flaming<span id = line_1053> [1053] </span>
<br>
mass of fire, much bigger than our own earth, and very, very far<span id = line_1054> [1054] </span>
<br>
away. The sun has its family of eight planets--of which the earth is<span id = line_1055> [1055] </span>
<br>
one--which travel around the sun; and around some of the planets there<span id = line_1056> [1056] </span>
<br>
travel satellites, or moons. The earth has such a satellite, the moon.<span id = line_1057> [1057] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1058> [1058] </span>
<br>
Now we have good reasons for believing that every star which twinkles<span id = line_1059> [1059] </span>
<br>
in the sky is a sun comparable to our own, having also its own planets<span id = line_1060> [1060] </span>
<br>
and its own moons. These stars, or suns, are so much further away<span id = line_1061> [1061] </span>
<br>
from us than our own sun, that but a speck of their light reaches us,<span id = line_1062> [1062] </span>
<br>
and then only at night, when, as the poets would say, our sun has<span id = line_1063> [1063] </span>
<br>
gone to its resting place.<span id = line_1064> [1064] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1065> [1065] </span>
<br>
The distances between bodies in the solar system is so immense that,<span id = line_1066> [1066] </span>
<br>
like the number of dollars spent in the Great War, the number of miles<span id = line_1067> [1067] </span>
<br>
conveys little, or no impression. But picture yourself in an express<span id = line_1068> [1068] </span>
<br>
train going at the average rate of 30 miles an hour. If you start<span id = line_1069> [1069] </span>
<br>
from New York and travel continuously you would reach San Francisco<span id = line_1070> [1070] </span>
<br>
in 4 days. If you could continue your journey around the earth at<span id = line_1071> [1071] </span>
<br>
the same rate you would complete it in 35 days. If now you could<span id = line_1072> [1072] </span>
<br>
travel into space and to the moon, still with the same velocity,<span id = line_1073> [1073] </span>
<br>
you would reach it in 350 days. Having reached the moon, you could<span id = line_1074> [1074] </span>
<br>
circumscribe it with the same express train in 8 days, as compared to<span id = line_1075> [1075] </span>
<br>
the 35 days it would take you to circumscribe the earth. If instead<span id = line_1076> [1076] </span>
<br>
of travelling to the moon you would book your passage for the sun<span id = line_1077> [1077] </span>
<br>
you, or rather your descendants, would get there in 350 years, and<span id = line_1078> [1078] </span>
<br>
it would then take them 10 additional years to travel around the sun.<span id = line_1079> [1079] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1080> [1080] </span>
<br>
Immense as these distances are, they are small as compared to the<span id = line_1081> [1081] </span>
<br>
distances that separate us from the stars. It takes light which,<span id = line_1082> [1082] </span>
<br>
instead of travelling 30 miles an hour, travels 186,000 miles a second,<span id = line_1083> [1083] </span>
<br>
about 8 minutes to get to us from the sun, and a little over 4 years<span id = line_1084> [1084] </span>
<br>
to reach us from the nearest star. The light from some of the other<span id = line_1085> [1085] </span>
<br>
stars do not reach us for several hundred years.<span id = line_1086> [1086] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1087> [1087] </span>
<br>
The Eclipse of the Sun. Now to return to an infinitesimal part of<span id = line_1088> [1088] </span>
<br>
the universe--our solar system. We have seen that the earth travels<span id = line_1089> [1089] </span>
<br>
around the sun, and the moon around the earth. At some time in the<span id = line_1090> [1090] </span>
<br>
course of these revolutions the moon must come directly between the<span id = line_1091> [1091] </span>
<br>
earth and the sun. Then we get the eclipse of the sun. As the moon<span id = line_1092> [1092] </span>
<br>
is smaller than the earth, only a portion of the earth's surface<span id = line_1093> [1093] </span>
<br>
will be cut off from the sun's rays. That portion which is so cut<span id = line_1094> [1094] </span>
<br>
off suffers a total eclipse. This explains why the eclipse of May,<span id = line_1095> [1095] </span>
<br>
1919, which was a total one for Brazil, was but a partial one for us.<span id = line_1096> [1096] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1097> [1097] </span>
<br>
Einstein's Assertion Re-stated. Einstein claimed that a ray of light<span id = line_1098> [1098] </span>
<br>
from one of the stars, if passing near enough to the surface of the<span id = line_1099> [1099] </span>
<br>
sun, would be appreciably deflected from its course; and he calculated<span id = line_1100> [1100] </span>
<br>
the exact amount of this deflection. To begin with, why should Einstein<span id = line_1101> [1101] </span>
<br>
suppose that the path of a ray of light would be affected by the son?<span id = line_1102> [1102] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1103> [1103] </span>
<br>
Newton's law of gravitation made it clear that bodies which have<span id = line_1104> [1104] </span>
<br>
mass attract one another. If light has mass--and very recent work<span id = line_1105> [1105] </span>
<br>
tends to show that it has--there is no reason why light should not be<span id = line_1106> [1106] </span>
<br>
attracted by the sun, or any other planetary body. The question that<span id = line_1107> [1107] </span>
<br>
agitated scientists was not so much whether a ray of light would be<span id = line_1108> [1108] </span>
<br>
deviated from its path, but to what extent this deviation would take<span id = line_1109> [1109] </span>
<br>
place. Would Einstein's figures be confirmed?<span id = line_1110> [1110] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1111> [1111] </span>
<br>
Of the bodies within our solar system the sun is by far the largest,<span id = line_1112> [1112] </span>
<br>
and therefore it would exert a far greater pull than any of the planets<span id = line_1113> [1113] </span>
<br>
on light rays coming from the stars. Under ordinary conditions,<span id = line_1114> [1114] </span>
<br>
however, the sun itself shines with such brilliancy, that objects<span id = line_1115> [1115] </span>
<br>
around it, including rays of light passing near its surface, are wholly<span id = line_1116> [1116] </span>
<br>
dimmed. Hence the necessity of putting our theory to the test only when<span id = line_1117> [1117] </span>
<br>
the moon covers up the sun--when there is a total eclipse of the sun.<span id = line_1118> [1118] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1119> [1119] </span>
<br>
A Graphical Representation. Imagine a star A, so selected that as<span id = line_1120> [1120] </span>
<br>
its light comes to us the ray just grazes the sun. If the path of<span id = line_1121> [1121] </span>
<br>
the ray is straight--if the sun has no influence on it--then the path<span id = line_1122> [1122] </span>
<br>
can be represented by the line AB. If, however, the sun does exert a<span id = line_1123> [1123] </span>
<br>
gravitational pull, then its real path will be AB', and to an observer<span id = line_1124> [1124] </span>
<br>
on the earth the star will have appeared to shift from A to A'.<span id = line_1125> [1125] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1126> [1126] </span>
<br>
What the Eclipse Expedition Set Out to Do. Photographs of stars<span id = line_1127> [1127] </span>
<br>
around the sun were to be taken during the eclipse, and these<span id = line_1128> [1128] </span>
<br>
photographs compared with others of the same region taken at night,<span id = line_1129> [1129] </span>
<br>
with the sun absent. Any apparent shifting of the stars could be<span id = line_1130> [1130] </span>
<br>
determined by measuring the distances between the stars as shown on<span id = line_1131> [1131] </span>
<br>
the photographic plates.<span id = line_1132> [1132] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1133> [1133] </span>
<br>
Three Possibilities Anticipated. According to Newton's assumption,<span id = line_1134> [1134] </span>
<br>
light consists of corpuscles, or minute particles, emitted from<span id = line_1135> [1135] </span>
<br>
the source of light. If this be true these particles, having mass,<span id = line_1136> [1136] </span>
<br>
should be affected by the gravitational pull of the sun. If we apply<span id = line_1137> [1137] </span>
<br>
Newton's theory of gravitation and make use of his formula, it can be<span id = line_1138> [1138] </span>
<br>
shown that such a gravitational pull would displace the ray of light<span id = line_1139> [1139] </span>
<br>
by an average amount equal to 0.75 (seconds of angular distance.) [4]<span id = line_1140> [1140] </span>
<br>
On the other hand, where light is regarded as waves set in motion in<span id = line_1141> [1141] </span>
<br>
the "ether" of space (the wave theory of light), and where weight is<span id = line_1142> [1142] </span>
<br>
denied light altogether, no deviation need be expected. Finally there<span id = line_1143> [1143] </span>
<br>
is a third alternative: Einstein's. Light, says Einstein, has mass,<span id = line_1144> [1144] </span>
<br>
and therefore probably weight. Mass is the matter light contains;<span id = line_1145> [1145] </span>
<br>
weight represents pull by gravity. Light rays will be attracted by<span id = line_1146> [1146] </span>
<br>
the sun, but according to Einstein's theory of gravitation the sun's<span id = line_1147> [1147] </span>
<br>
gravitational pull will displace the rays by an average amount equal<span id = line_1148> [1148] </span>
<br>
to 1.75 (seconds of angular distance).<span id = line_1149> [1149] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1150> [1150] </span>
<br>
The Expeditions. That science is highly international, despite many<span id = line_1151> [1151] </span>
<br>
recent examples to the contrary, is evidenced by this British Eclipse<span id = line_1152> [1152] </span>
<br>
Expedition. Here was a theory propounded by one who had accepted a<span id = line_1153> [1153] </span>
<br>
chair of physics in the university of Berlin, and across the English<span id = line_1154> [1154] </span>
<br>
Channel were Germany's mortal enemies making elaborate preparations<span id = line_1155> [1155] </span>
<br>
to test the validity of the Berlin professor's theory.<span id = line_1156> [1156] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1157> [1157] </span>
<br>
The British Astronomical Society began to plan the eclipse expedition<span id = line_1158> [1158] </span>
<br>
even before the outbreak of the Great War. During the years that<span id = line_1159> [1159] </span>
<br>
followed, despite the destinies of nations which hung on threads from<span id = line_1160> [1160] </span>
<br>
day to day, despite the darkest hours in the history of the British<span id = line_1161> [1161] </span>
<br>
people, our English astronomers continued to give attention to the<span id = line_1162> [1162] </span>
<br>
details of the proposed expedition. When the day of the eclipse came<span id = line_1163> [1163] </span>
<br>
all was in readiness.<span id = line_1164> [1164] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1165> [1165] </span>
<br>
One expedition under Dr. Crommelin was sent to Sobral, Brazil; another,<span id = line_1166> [1166] </span>
<br>
under Prof. Eddington, to Principe, an island off the west coast of<span id = line_1167> [1167] </span>
<br>
Africa. In both these places a total eclipse was anticipated.<span id = line_1168> [1168] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1169> [1169] </span>
<br>
The eclipse occurred on May 29, 1919. It lasted for six to eight<span id = line_1170> [1170] </span>
<br>
minutes. Some 15 photographs, with an average exposure of five to six<span id = line_1171> [1171] </span>
<br>
seconds, were taken. Two months later another series of photographs<span id = line_1172> [1172] </span>
<br>
of the same region were taken, but this time the sun was no longer<span id = line_1173> [1173] </span>
<br>
in the midst of these stars.<span id = line_1174> [1174] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1175> [1175] </span>
<br>
The photographs were brought to the famous Greenwich Observatory,<span id = line_1176> [1176] </span>
<br>
near London, and the astronomers and mathematicians began their<span id = line_1177> [1177] </span>
<br>
laborious measurements and calculations.<span id = line_1178> [1178] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1179> [1179] </span>
<br>
On November 6, at the meeting of the Royal Society, the result<span id = line_1180> [1180] </span>
<br>
was announced. The Sobral expedition reported 1.98; the Principe<span id = line_1181> [1181] </span>
<br>
expedition 1.62. The average was 1.8. Einstein had predicted 1.75,<span id = line_1182> [1182] </span>
<br>
Newton might have predicted 0.75, and the orthodox scientists would<span id = line_1183> [1183] </span>
<br>
have predicted 0. There could now no longer be any question as to which<span id = line_1184> [1184] </span>
<br>
of the three theories rested on a sure foundation. To quote Sir Frank<span id = line_1185> [1185] </span>
<br>
Dyson, the Astronomer Royal: "After a careful study of the plates I am<span id = line_1186> [1186] </span>
<br>
prepared to say that there can be no doubt that they confirm Einstein's<span id = line_1187> [1187] </span>
<br>
prediction. A very definite result has been obtained that light is<span id = line_1188> [1188] </span>
<br>
deflected in accordance with Einstein's law of gravitation." [5]<span id = line_1189> [1189] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1190> [1190] </span>
<br>
Where Did Einstein Get His Idea of Gravitation? In 1905 Einstein<span id = line_1191> [1191] </span>
<br>
published the first of a series of papers supporting and extending a<span id = line_1192> [1192] </span>
<br>
theory of time and space to which the name "the theory of relativity"<span id = line_1193> [1193] </span>
<br>
had been given. These views as expounded by Einstein came into direct<span id = line_1194> [1194] </span>
<br>
conflict with Newton's ideas of time and space, and also with Newton's<span id = line_1195> [1195] </span>
<br>
law of gravitation. Since Einstein had more faith in his theory of<span id = line_1196> [1196] </span>
<br>
relativity than in Newton's theory of gravitation, Einstein so changed<span id = line_1197> [1197] </span>
<br>
the latter as to make it harmonize with the former. More will be said<span id = line_1198> [1198] </span>
<br>
on this subject.<span id = line_1199> [1199] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1200> [1200] </span>
<br>
Let not the reader misunderstand. Newton was not wholly in the wrong;<span id = line_1201> [1201] </span>
<br>
he was only approximately right. With the knowledge existing in<span id = line_1202> [1202] </span>
<br>
Newton's day Newton could have done no more than he did; no mortal<span id = line_1203> [1203] </span>
<br>
could have done more. But since Newton's day physics--and science in<span id = line_1204> [1204] </span>
<br>
general--has advanced in great strides, and Einstein can interpret<span id = line_1205> [1205] </span>
<br>
present-day knowledge in the same masterful fashion that Newton<span id = line_1206> [1206] </span>
<br>
could in his day. With more facts to build upon, Einstein's law<span id = line_1207> [1207] </span>
<br>
of gravitation is more universal than Newton's; it really includes<span id = line_1208> [1208] </span>
<br>
Newton's.<span id = line_1209> [1209] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1210> [1210] </span>
<br>
But now we must turn our attention very briefly to the theory of<span id = line_1211> [1211] </span>
<br>
relativity--the theory that led up to Einstein's law of gravitation.<span id = line_1212> [1212] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1213> [1213] </span>
<br>
The Theory of Relativity. The story goes that Einstein was led to<span id = line_1214> [1214] </span>
<br>
his ideas by watching a man fall from a roof. This story bears a<span id = line_1215> [1215] </span>
<br>
striking similarity to Newton and the apple. Perhaps one is as true<span id = line_1216> [1216] </span>
<br>
as the other. [6]<span id = line_1217> [1217] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1218> [1218] </span>
<br>
However that may be, the principle of relativity is as old as<span id = line_1219> [1219] </span>
<br>
philosophical thought, for it denies the possibility of measuring<span id = line_1220> [1220] </span>
<br>
absolute time, or absolute space. All things are relative. We say<span id = line_1221> [1221] </span>
<br>
that it takes a "long time" to get from New York to Albany; long as<span id = line_1222> [1222] </span>
<br>
compared to what? long, perhaps, as compared to the time it takes to<span id = line_1223> [1223] </span>
<br>
go from New York City to Brooklyn. We say the White House is "large";<span id = line_1224> [1224] </span>
<br>
large when compared to a room in an apartment. But we can just as<span id = line_1225> [1225] </span>
<br>
well reverse our ideas of time and distance. The time it takes to go<span id = line_1226> [1226] </span>
<br>
from New York to Albany is "short" when compared to the time it takes<span id = line_1227> [1227] </span>
<br>
to go from New York to San Francisco. The size of the White House is<span id = line_1228> [1228] </span>
<br>
"small" when compared to the size of the city of Washington.<span id = line_1229> [1229] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1230> [1230] </span>
<br>
Let us take another illustration. Every time the earth turns on its<span id = line_1231> [1231] </span>
<br>
axis we mark down as a day. With this as a basis, we say that it<span id = line_1232> [1232] </span>
<br>
takes a little over 365 days for the earth to complete its revolution<span id = line_1233> [1233] </span>
<br>
around the sun, and our 365 days we call a year. But now consider some<span id = line_1234> [1234] </span>
<br>
of our other planets. With our time as a basis, it takes Jupiter or<span id = line_1235> [1235] </span>
<br>
Saturn 10 hours to turn on its axis, as compared to the 24 hours it<span id = line_1236> [1236] </span>
<br>
takes the earth to turn. Saturn's day is less than one-half our day,<span id = line_1237> [1237] </span>
<br>
and our day is more than twice Saturn's--that is, according to the<span id = line_1238> [1238] </span>
<br>
calculations of the inhabitants of the earth. Mercury completes her<span id = line_1239> [1239] </span>
<br>
circuit around the sun in 88 days; Neptune, in 164 years. Mercury's<span id = line_1240> [1240] </span>
<br>
year is but one-fourth ours, Neptune's, 164 times ours. And observers<span id = line_1241> [1241] </span>
<br>
at Mercury and Neptune would regard us from their standard of time,<span id = line_1242> [1242] </span>
<br>
which differs from our standard.<span id = line_1243> [1243] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1244> [1244] </span>
<br>
You may say, why not take our standard of time as the standard,<span id = line_1245> [1245] </span>
<br>
and measure everything by it? But why should you? Such a selection<span id = line_1246> [1246] </span>
<br>
would be quite arbitrary. It would not be based on anything absolute,<span id = line_1247> [1247] </span>
<br>
but would merely depend on our velocity around the sun.<span id = line_1248> [1248] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1249> [1249] </span>
<br>
These ideas are old enough in metaphysics. Einstein's improvement<span id = line_1250> [1250] </span>
<br>
of them consists not merely in speculating about them, but in giving<span id = line_1251> [1251] </span>
<br>
them mathematical form.<span id = line_1252> [1252] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1253> [1253] </span>
<br>
The Origin of the Theory of Relativity. A train moves with reference<span id = line_1254> [1254] </span>
<br>
to the earth. The earth moves with reference to the sun. We say the<span id = line_1255> [1255] </span>
<br>
sun is stationary and the earth moves around the sun. But how do we<span id = line_1256> [1256] </span>
<br>
know that the sun itself does not move with reference to some other<span id = line_1257> [1257] </span>
<br>
body? How do we know that our planetary system, and the stars, and<span id = line_1258> [1258] </span>
<br>
the cosmos as a whole is not in motion?<span id = line_1259> [1259] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1260> [1260] </span>
<br>
There is no way of answering such a question unless we could get a<span id = line_1261> [1261] </span>
<br>
point of reference which is fixed--fixed absolutely in space.<span id = line_1262> [1262] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1263> [1263] </span>
<br>
We have already alluded to our view of the nature of light, known as<span id = line_1264> [1264] </span>
<br>
the wave theory of light. This theory postulates the existence of an<span id = line_1265> [1265] </span>
<br>
all-pervading "ether" in space. Light sets up wave disturbances in<span id = line_1266> [1266] </span>
<br>
this ether, and is thus propagated. If the ocean were the ether, the<span id = line_1267> [1267] </span>
<br>
waves of the ocean would compare with the waves set up by the ether.<span id = line_1268> [1268] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1269> [1269] </span>
<br>
But what is this ether? It cannot be seen. It defies weight. It<span id = line_1270> [1270] </span>
<br>
permeates all space. It permeates all matter. So say the exponents of<span id = line_1271> [1271] </span>
<br>
this ether. To the layman this sounds very much like another name<span id = line_1272> [1272] </span>
<br>
for the Deity. To Sir Oliver Lodge it represents the spirits of<span id = line_1273> [1273] </span>
<br>
the departed.<span id = line_1274> [1274] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1275> [1275] </span>
<br>
To us, of importance is the conception that this ether is absolutely<span id = line_1276> [1276] </span>
<br>
stationary. Such a conception is logical if the various developments in<span id = line_1277> [1277] </span>
<br>
optics and electricity are considered. But if absolutely stationary,<span id = line_1278> [1278] </span>
<br>
then the ether is the long-sought-for point of reference, the guide<span id = line_1279> [1279] </span>
<br>
to determine the motion of all bodies in the universe.<span id = line_1280> [1280] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1281> [1281] </span>
<br>
The Famous Experiment Performed by Prof. Michelson. If there is an<span id = line_1282> [1282] </span>
<br>
ether, and a stationary ether, and if the earth moves with reference to<span id = line_1283> [1283] </span>
<br>
this ether, the earth, in moving, must set up ether "currents"--just<span id = line_1284> [1284] </span>
<br>
as when a train moves it sets up air currents. So reasoned Michelson,<span id = line_1285> [1285] </span>
<br>
a young Annapolis graduate at the time. And forthwith he devised a<span id = line_1286> [1286] </span>
<br>
crucial experiment the explanation of which we can simplify by the<span id = line_1287> [1287] </span>
<br>
following analogy:<span id = line_1288> [1288] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1289> [1289] </span>
<br>
Which is the quicker, to swim up stream a certain length, say a<span id = line_1290> [1290] </span>
<br>
hundred yards, and back again, or across stream the same length and<span id = line_1291> [1291] </span>
<br>
back again? The swimmer will answer that the up-and-down journey is<span id = line_1292> [1292] </span>
<br>
longer. [7]<span id = line_1293> [1293] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1294> [1294] </span>
<br>
Our river is the ether. The earth, if moving in this ether, will<span id = line_1295> [1295] </span>
<br>
set up an ether stream, the up stream being parallel to the earth's<span id = line_1296> [1296] </span>
<br>
motion. Now suppose we send a beam of light a certain distance up<span id = line_1297> [1297] </span>
<br>
this ether stream and back, and note the time; and then turn the<span id = line_1298> [1298] </span>
<br>
beam of light at right angles and send it an equal distance across<span id = line_1299> [1299] </span>
<br>
the stream and back, and note the time. How will the time taken for<span id = line_1300> [1300] </span>
<br>
light to travel in these two directions compare? Reasoning by analogy,<span id = line_1301> [1301] </span>
<br>
the up-and-down stream should take longer.<span id = line_1302> [1302] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1303> [1303] </span>
<br>
Michelson's results did not accord with analogy. No difference in time<span id = line_1304> [1304] </span>
<br>
could be detected between the beam of light travelling up-and-down,<span id = line_1305> [1305] </span>
<br>
and across-and-back.<span id = line_1306> [1306] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1307> [1307] </span>
<br>
But this was contrary to all reason if the postulate of an ether was<span id = line_1308> [1308] </span>
<br>
sound. Must we then revise our ideas of an ether? Perhaps after all<span id = line_1309> [1309] </span>
<br>
there is no ether.<span id = line_1310> [1310] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1311> [1311] </span>
<br>
But if no ether, how are we to explain the propagation of light in<span id = line_1312> [1312] </span>
<br>
space, and various electrical phenomena connected with it, such as<span id = line_1313> [1313] </span>
<br>
the Hertzian, or wireless waves?<span id = line_1314> [1314] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1315> [1315] </span>
<br>
There was another alternative, one suggested by Larmor in England<span id = line_1316> [1316] </span>
<br>
and Lorentz in Holland,--that matter is contracted in the direction<span id = line_1317> [1317] </span>
<br>
of its motion through the ether current. To say that bodies are<span id = line_1318> [1318] </span>
<br>
actually shortened in the direction of their motion--by an amount<span id = line_1319> [1319] </span>
<br>
which increases as the velocity of these bodies approaches that of<span id = line_1320> [1320] </span>
<br>
light--is so revolutionary an idea that Larmor and Lorentz would<span id = line_1321> [1321] </span>
<br>
hardly have adopted such a viewpoint but for the fact that recent<span id = line_1322> [1322] </span>
<br>
investigations into the nature of matter gave basis for such belief.<span id = line_1323> [1323] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1324> [1324] </span>
<br>
Matter, it has been shown, is electrical in nature. The forces which<span id = line_1325> [1325] </span>
<br>
hold the particles together are electrical. Lorentz showed that<span id = line_1326> [1326] </span>
<br>
mathematical formulas for electrical forces could be developed which<span id = line_1327> [1327] </span>
<br>
would inevitably lead to the view that material bodies contract in<span id = line_1328> [1328] </span>
<br>
the direction of their motion. [8]<span id = line_1329> [1329] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1330> [1330] </span>
<br>
"But this is ridiculous," you say; "if I am shorter in one direction<span id = line_1331> [1331] </span>
<br>
than in another I would notice it." You would if some things were<span id = line_1332> [1332] </span>
<br>
shortened and others were not. But if all things pointing in a certain<span id = line_1333> [1333] </span>
<br>
direction are shortened to an equal extent, how are you going to notice<span id = line_1334> [1334] </span>
<br>
it? Will you apply the yard stick? That has been shortened. Will you<span id = line_1335> [1335] </span>
<br>
pass judgment with the help of your eyes? But your retina has also<span id = line_1336> [1336] </span>
<br>
contracted. In brief, if all things contract to the same amount it<span id = line_1337> [1337] </span>
<br>
is as if there were no contraction at all.<span id = line_1338> [1338] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1339> [1339] </span>
<br>
Lorentz's Plausible Explanation Really Deepens the Mystery. The<span id = line_1340> [1340] </span>
<br>
startling ideas just outlined have opened up several new vistas,<span id = line_1341> [1341] </span>
<br>
but they have left unanswered the two problems we set out to solve:<span id = line_1342> [1342] </span>
<br>
whether there is an ether, and if so, what is the velocity of the earth<span id = line_1343> [1343] </span>
<br>
in reference to this ether? Lorentz maintains that there is an ether,<span id = line_1344> [1344] </span>
<br>
but the velocities of bodies relative to it must forever remain a<span id = line_1345> [1345] </span>
<br>
mystery. As you change your position your distances change; you change;<span id = line_1346> [1346] </span>
<br>
everything about you changes accordingly; and all basis for comparison<span id = line_1347> [1347] </span>
<br>
is lost. Nature has entered into a conspiracy to keep you ignorant.<span id = line_1348> [1348] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1349> [1349] </span>
<br>
Einstein Comes upon the Scene. Einstein starts with the assumption<span id = line_1350> [1350] </span>
<br>
that there is no possible way of identifying this ether. Suppose we<span id = line_1351> [1351] </span>
<br>
ignore the ether altogether, what then? [9]<span id = line_1352> [1352] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1353> [1353] </span>
<br>
If we do ignore the ether we no longer have any absolute point of<span id = line_1354> [1354] </span>
<br>
reference; for if the ether is considered stationary the velocity of<span id = line_1355> [1355] </span>
<br>
all bodies within the ether may be referred to it; any point in space<span id = line_1356> [1356] </span>
<br>
may be considered a fixed point. If, however, there is no ether, or if<span id = line_1357> [1357] </span>
<br>
we are to ignore it, how are we to get the velocity of bodies in space?<span id = line_1358> [1358] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1359> [1359] </span>
<br>
The Principle of Relativity. If we are to believe in the "causal<span id = line_1360> [1360] </span>
<br>
relationship between only such things as lie within the realm of<span id = line_1361> [1361] </span>
<br>
observation," then observation teaches us that bodies move only<span id = line_1362> [1362] </span>
<br>
relative to one another, and that the idea of absolute motion of a<span id = line_1363> [1363] </span>
<br>
body in space is meaningless. Einstein, therefore, postulates that<span id = line_1364> [1364] </span>
<br>
there is no such thing as absolute motion, and that all we can discuss<span id = line_1365> [1365] </span>
<br>
is the relative motion of one body with respect to another. This<span id = line_1366> [1366] </span>
<br>
is just as logical a deduction from Michelson's experiment as the<span id = line_1367> [1367] </span>
<br>
attempt to explain Michelson's anomalous results in the light of an<span id = line_1368> [1368] </span>
<br>
all-pervading ether.<span id = line_1369> [1369] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1370> [1370] </span>
<br>
Consider for a moment Newton's scheme. This great pioneer pictured<span id = line_1371> [1371] </span>
<br>
an absolute standard of position in space relative to which all<span id = line_1372> [1372] </span>
<br>
velocities are measured. Velocities were measured by noting the<span id = line_1373> [1373] </span>
<br>
distance covered and dividing the result by the time taken to cover<span id = line_1374> [1374] </span>
<br>
the distance. Space was a definite entity; and so was time. "Time,"<span id = line_1375> [1375] </span>
<br>
said Newton, "flows evenly on," independent of aught else. To Newton<span id = line_1376> [1376] </span>
<br>
time and space were entirely different, in no way to be confounded.<span id = line_1377> [1377] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1378> [1378] </span>
<br>
Just as Newton conceived of absolute space, so he conceived of absolute<span id = line_1379> [1379] </span>
<br>
time. From the latter standard of reference the idea of a "simultaneity<span id = line_1380> [1380] </span>
<br>
of events" at different places arose. But now if there is no standard<span id = line_1381> [1381] </span>
<br>
of reference, if the ether does not exist or does not function, if<span id = line_1382> [1382] </span>
<br>
two points A and B cannot be referred to a third, and fixed point C,<span id = line_1383> [1383] </span>
<br>
how can we talk of "simultaneity of events" at A and B? [10]<span id = line_1384> [1384] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1385> [1385] </span>
<br>
In fact, Einstein shows that if all you can speak about is relative<span id = line_1386> [1386] </span>
<br>
motion, then one event which takes say one minute on one planet would<span id = line_1387> [1387] </span>
<br>
not take one minute on another. For consider two bodies in space,<span id = line_1388> [1388] </span>
<br>
say the planets Venus and the earth, with an observer B on Venus<span id = line_1389> [1389] </span>
<br>
and another A on the earth. B notes the time taken for a ray of<span id = line_1390> [1390] </span>
<br>
light to travel from B to the distance M. A on the earth has means<span id = line_1391> [1391] </span>
<br>
of observing the same event. B records one minute. A is puzzled,<span id = line_1392> [1392] </span>
<br>
for his watch records a little more than one minute. What is the<span id = line_1393> [1393] </span>
<br>
explanation? Granting that the two clocks register the same time<span id = line_1394> [1394] </span>
<br>
to start with, and assuming further Einstein's hypothesis that the<span id = line_1395> [1395] </span>
<br>
velocity of light is independent of its source, the difference in<span id = line_1396> [1396] </span>
<br>
time is due to the fact that the planet Venus moves with reference to<span id = line_1397> [1397] </span>
<br>
the observer on the earth; so that A in reality does not measure the<span id = line_1398> [1398] </span>
<br>
path BM and MB, but BM' and M'B', where BB' represents the distance<span id = line_1399> [1399] </span>
<br>
Venus itself has moved in the interval. And if you put yourself in B's<span id = line_1400> [1400] </span>
<br>
position on Venus the situation is exactly reversed. All of which is<span id = line_1401> [1401] </span>
<br>
simply another way of saying that what is a certain time on one body<span id = line_1402> [1402] </span>
<br>
in space is another time on another body in space. There is nothing<span id = line_1403> [1403] </span>
<br>
definite in time.<span id = line_1404> [1404] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1405> [1405] </span>
<br>
Prof. Cohen's Illustration. Further bewildering possibilities are<span id = line_1406> [1406] </span>
<br>
clearly outlined in this apt illustration: "If when you are going away<span id = line_1407> [1407] </span>
<br>
on a long and continuous journey you write home at regular intervals,<span id = line_1408> [1408] </span>
<br>
you should not be surprised that with the best possible mail service<span id = line_1409> [1409] </span>
<br>
your letters will reach home at progressively longer intervals,<span id = line_1410> [1410] </span>
<br>
since each letter will have a greater distance to travel than its<span id = line_1411> [1411] </span>
<br>
predecessor. If you were armed with instruments to hear the home<span id = line_1412> [1412] </span>
<br>
clock ticking, you would find that as your distance from home keeps<span id = line_1413> [1413] </span>
<br>
on increasing, the intervals between the successive ticks (that is,<span id = line_1414> [1414] </span>
<br>
its seconds) grow longer, so that if you travelled with the velocity<span id = line_1415> [1415] </span>
<br>
of sound the home clock would seem to slow down to a standstill--you<span id = line_1416> [1416] </span>
<br>
would never hear the next tick.<span id = line_1417> [1417] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1418> [1418] </span>
<br>
"Precisely the same is true if you substitute light rays for sound<span id = line_1419> [1419] </span>
<br>
waves. If with the naked eye or with a telescope you watch a clock<span id = line_1420> [1420] </span>
<br>
moving away from you, you will find that its minute hand takes a longer<span id = line_1421> [1421] </span>
<br>
time to cover its five-minute intervals than does the chronometer in<span id = line_1422> [1422] </span>
<br>
your hand, and if the clock travelled with the velocity of light you<span id = line_1423> [1423] </span>
<br>
would forever see the minute hand at precisely the same point. That<span id = line_1424> [1424] </span>
<br>
which is true of the clock is, of course, also true of all time<span id = line_1425> [1425] </span>
<br>
intervals which it measures, so that if you moved away from the earth<span id = line_1426> [1426] </span>
<br>
with the velocity of light everything on it would appear as still as<span id = line_1427> [1427] </span>
<br>
on a painted canvas."<span id = line_1428> [1428] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1429> [1429] </span>
<br>
Your time has apparently come to a standstill in one position and<span id = line_1430> [1430] </span>
<br>
is moving in another! All this seems absurd enough, but it does show<span id = line_1431> [1431] </span>
<br>
that time alone has little meaning.<span id = line_1432> [1432] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1433> [1433] </span>
<br>
Minkowski's Conclusion. The relativity theory requires that we<span id = line_1434> [1434] </span>
<br>
thoroughly reorganise our method of measuring time. But this is<span id = line_1435> [1435] </span>
<br>
intimately associated with our method of measuring space, the distance<span id = line_1436> [1436] </span>
<br>
between two points. As we proceed we find that space without time has<span id = line_1437> [1437] </span>
<br>
little meaning, and vice versa. This leads Minkowski to the conclusion<span id = line_1438> [1438] </span>
<br>
that "time by itself and space by itself are mere shadows; they are<span id = line_1439> [1439] </span>
<br>
only two aspects of a single and indivisible manner of coordinating<span id = line_1440> [1440] </span>
<br>
the facts of the physical world." Einstein incorporated this time-space<span id = line_1441> [1441] </span>
<br>
idea in his theory of relativity.<span id = line_1442> [1442] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1443> [1443] </span>
<br>
How We Measure a Point in Space. Suppose I say to you that the chemical<span id = line_1444> [1444] </span>
<br>
laboratory of Columbia University faces Broadway; would that locate<span id = line_1445> [1445] </span>
<br>
the laboratory? Hardly, for any building along Broadway would face<span id = line_1446> [1446] </span>
<br>
Broadway. But suppose I add that it is situated at Broadway and 117th<span id = line_1447> [1447] </span>
<br>
Street, south-east? there could be little doubt then. But if, further,<span id = line_1448> [1448] </span>
<br>
this laboratory would occupy but part of the building, say the third<span id = line_1449> [1449] </span>
<br>
floor; then the situation would be specified by naming Broadway,<span id = line_1450> [1450] </span>
<br>
117th Street S. E., third floor. If Broadway represents length, 117th<span id = line_1451> [1451] </span>
<br>
Street width, and third floor height, we can see what is meant when we<span id = line_1452> [1452] </span>
<br>
say that three dimensions are required to locate a position in space.<span id = line_1453> [1453] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1454> [1454] </span>
<br>
The Fourth Dimension. A point on a line may be located by one<span id = line_1455> [1455] </span>
<br>
dimension; a point on a wall requires two dimensions; a point in the<span id = line_1456> [1456] </span>
<br>
room, like the chemical laboratory above ground, needs three. The<span id = line_1457> [1457] </span>
<br>
layman cannot grasp the meaning of a fourth dimension; yet the<span id = line_1458> [1458] </span>
<br>
mathematician does imagine it, and plays with it in mathematical<span id = line_1459> [1459] </span>
<br>
terms. Minkowski and Einstein picture time as the fourth dimension. To<span id = line_1460> [1460] </span>
<br>
them time occupies no more important position than length, breadth,<span id = line_1461> [1461] </span>
<br>
or thickness, and is as intimately related to these three as the three<span id = line_1462> [1462] </span>
<br>
are to one another. H. G. Wells, the novelist, has beautifully caught<span id = line_1463> [1463] </span>
<br>
this spirit when in his novel, "The Time Machine," he makes his hero<span id = line_1464> [1464] </span>
<br>
travel backwards and forwards along time just as a man might go north<span id = line_1465> [1465] </span>
<br>
or south. When the man with his time machine goes forward he is in<span id = line_1466> [1466] </span>
<br>
the future; when he goes backwards he is in the past.<span id = line_1467> [1467] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1468> [1468] </span>
<br>
In reality, if we stop to think a minute, there is no valid<span id = line_1469> [1469] </span>
<br>
reason for the non-existence of a fourth dimension. If one, two<span id = line_1470> [1470] </span>
<br>
and three dimensions, why not four--and five and six, for that<span id = line_1471> [1471] </span>
<br>
matter? Theoretically at least there is no reason why the limit<span id = line_1472> [1472] </span>
<br>
should be set at three. However, our minds become sluggish when we<span id = line_1473> [1473] </span>
<br>
attempt to picture dimensions beyond three; just as an extraordinary<span id = line_1474> [1474] </span>
<br>
effort on our part is needed to follow Einstein when he "juggles"<span id = line_1475> [1475] </span>
<br>
with space and time.<span id = line_1476> [1476] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1477> [1477] </span>
<br>
Our difficulty in imagining four dimensions may be likened to the<span id = line_1478> [1478] </span>
<br>
difficulty two-dimensioned beings would experience in imagining<span id = line_1479> [1479] </span>
<br>
us, beings of the conventional three dimensions. Suppose these<span id = line_1480> [1480] </span>
<br>
two-dimensional beings were living on the surface of the earth;<span id = line_1481> [1481] </span>
<br>
what could they see? They could see nothing below and nothing above<span id = line_1482> [1482] </span>
<br>
the surface. They would see shifting surfaces as we walked about,<span id = line_1483> [1483] </span>
<br>
but being sensitive to length and breadth only, and not to height,<span id = line_1484> [1484] </span>
<br>
they could gain no notion whatsoever of what we really look like. It<span id = line_1485> [1485] </span>
<br>
is thus with us when we attempt to picture four-dimensional space.<span id = line_1486> [1486] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1487> [1487] </span>
<br>
Perhaps the analogy of the motion picture may help us somewhat. As<span id = line_1488> [1488] </span>
<br>
everybody knows, these motion pictures consist of a series of<span id = line_1489> [1489] </span>
<br>
photographs which are shown in rapid succession on the screen. Each<span id = line_1490> [1490] </span>
<br>
photograph by itself conveys a sensation of space, that is, of three<span id = line_1491> [1491] </span>
<br>
dimensions; but one photograph rapidly following another conveys<span id = line_1492> [1492] </span>
<br>
the sensation of space and time--four dimensions. Space and time<span id = line_1493> [1493] </span>
<br>
are interlinked.<span id = line_1494> [1494] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1495> [1495] </span>
<br>
The Time-space Idea Further Developed. We have already alluded to the<span id = line_1496> [1496] </span>
<br>
fact that objects in space moving with different velocities build up<span id = line_1497> [1497] </span>
<br>
different time intervals. Thus the velocity of the star Arcturus, if<span id = line_1498> [1498] </span>
<br>
compared with reference to the earth, moves at the rate of 200 miles a<span id = line_1499> [1499] </span>
<br>
second. Its motion through space is different from ours. Objects which,<span id = line_1500> [1500] </span>
<br>
according to Lorentz, contract in the direction of their motion to an<span id = line_1501> [1501] </span>
<br>
extent proportional to their velocity, will contract differently on<span id = line_1502> [1502] </span>
<br>
the surface of Arcturus than on the earth. Our space is not Arcturus'<span id = line_1503> [1503] </span>
<br>
space; neither is Arcturus' time our time. And what is true of the<span id = line_1504> [1504] </span>
<br>
discrepancies existing between the space and time conceptions of the<span id = line_1505> [1505] </span>
<br>
earth and Arcturus is true of any other two bodies in space moving<span id = line_1506> [1506] </span>
<br>
at different velocities.<span id = line_1507> [1507] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1508> [1508] </span>
<br>
But is there no relationship existing between the space and time<span id = line_1509> [1509] </span>
<br>
of one body in the universe as compared to the space and time of<span id = line_1510> [1510] </span>
<br>
another? Can we not find something which holds good for all bodies<span id = line_1511> [1511] </span>
<br>
in the universe? We can. We can express it mathematically. It is the<span id = line_1512> [1512] </span>
<br>
concept of time and space interlinked; of time as the fourth dimension,<span id = line_1513> [1513] </span>
<br>
length, breadth and thickness being the other three; of time as<span id = line_1514> [1514] </span>
<br>
one of four co-ordinates and at right angles to the other three<span id = line_1515> [1515] </span>
<br>
(a situation which requires a terrific stretch of the imagination<span id = line_1516> [1516] </span>
<br>
to visualize). The four dimensions are sufficient to co-ordinate<span id = line_1517> [1517] </span>
<br>
the time-space relationships of all bodies in the cosmos, and hence<span id = line_1518> [1518] </span>
<br>
have a universality which is totally lacking when time and space<span id = line_1519> [1519] </span>
<br>
are used independently of one another. The four components of our<span id = line_1520> [1520] </span>
<br>
time-space are up-and-down, right-and-left, backwards-and-forwards,<span id = line_1521> [1521] </span>
<br>
and sooner-and-later.<span id = line_1522> [1522] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1523> [1523] </span>
<br>
"Strain" and "Distortion" in Space. The four-dimensional unit has been<span id = line_1524> [1524] </span>
<br>
given the name "world-line," for the "world-line" of any particle in<span id = line_1525> [1525] </span>
<br>
space is in reality a complete history of that particle as it moves<span id = line_1526> [1526] </span>
<br>
about in space. Particles, we know, attract one another. If each<span id = line_1527> [1527] </span>
<br>
particle is represented by a world-line these world-lines will be<span id = line_1528> [1528] </span>
<br>
deflected from their course owing to such attraction.<span id = line_1529> [1529] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1530> [1530] </span>
<br>
Imagine a bladder representing the universe, with lines on it<span id = line_1531> [1531] </span>
<br>
representing world-lines. Now squeeze the bladder. The world-lines are<span id = line_1532> [1532] </span>
<br>
bent in various directions; they are "distorted." This illustrates the<span id = line_1533> [1533] </span>
<br>
influence of gravity on these world-lines; it is the "strain" brought<span id = line_1534> [1534] </span>
<br>
about due to the force of attraction. The distorted bladder illustrates<span id = line_1535> [1535] </span>
<br>
even more, for it is a true representation of the real world.<span id = line_1536> [1536] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1537> [1537] </span>
<br>
How Einstein's Conception of Time and Space Led to a New View of<span id = line_1538> [1538] </span>
<br>
Gravitation. In our conventional language we speak of the sun as<span id = line_1539> [1539] </span>
<br>
exerting a "force" on the earth. We have seen, however, that this<span id = line_1540> [1540] </span>
<br>
force brings about a "distortion" or "strain" in world-lines; or,<span id = line_1541> [1541] </span>
<br>
what amounts to the same thing, a "distortion" or "strain" of time<span id = line_1542> [1542] </span>
<br>
and space. The sun's "force," the "force" of any body in space, is the<span id = line_1543> [1543] </span>
<br>
"force" due to gravity; and these "forces" may now be treated in terms<span id = line_1544> [1544] </span>
<br>
of the laws of time and space. "The earth," Prof. Eddington tells us,<span id = line_1545> [1545] </span>
<br>
"moves in a curved orbit, not because the sun exerts any direct pull,<span id = line_1546> [1546] </span>
<br>
but because the earth is trying to find the shortest way through a<span id = line_1547> [1547] </span>
<br>
space and time which have been tangled up by an influence radiating<span id = line_1548> [1548] </span>
<br>
from the sun." [11]<span id = line_1549> [1549] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1550> [1550] </span>
<br>
At this point Newton's conceptions fail, for his views and his laws<span id = line_1551> [1551] </span>
<br>
do not include "strains" in space. Newton's law of gravitation must<span id = line_1552> [1552] </span>
<br>
be supplanted by one which does include such distortions. It is<span id = line_1553> [1553] </span>
<br>
Einstein's great glory to have supplied us with this new law.<span id = line_1554> [1554] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1555> [1555] </span>
<br>
Einstein's Law of Gravitation. This appears to be the only law<span id = line_1556> [1556] </span>
<br>
which meets all requirements. It includes Newton's law, and cannot be<span id = line_1557> [1557] </span>
<br>
distinguished from it if our experiments are confined to the earth and<span id = line_1558> [1558] </span>
<br>
deal with relatively small velocities. But when we betake ourselves<span id = line_1559> [1559] </span>
<br>
to some orbits in space, with a gravitational pull much greater than<span id = line_1560> [1560] </span>
<br>
the earth's, and when we deal with velocities comparable to that of<span id = line_1561> [1561] </span>

light, the differences become marked.<span id = line_1562> [1562] </span>

<br>
Einstein's Theory Scores Its First Great Victory. In the beginning<span id = line_1564> [1564] </span>
<br>
of this chapter we referred to the elaborate eclipse expedition sent<span id = line_1565> [1565] </span>
<br>
by the British to test the validity of Einstein's new theory of<span id = line_1566> [1566] </span>
<br>
gravitation. The British scientists would hardly have expended so<span id = line_1567> [1567] </span>
<br>
much time and energy on this theory of Einstein's but for the fact<span id = line_1568> [1568] </span>
<br>
that Einstein had already scored one great victory. What was it?<span id = line_1569> [1569] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1570> [1570] </span>
<br>
Imagine but a single planet revolving about the sun. According to<span id = line_1571> [1571] </span>
<br>
Newton's law of gravitation, the planet's path would be that of an<span id = line_1572> [1572] </span>
<br>
ellipse--that is, oval--and the planet would travel indefinitely along<span id = line_1573> [1573] </span>
<br>
this path. According to Einstein the path would also be elliptical,<span id = line_1574> [1574] </span>
<br>
but before a revolution would be quite completed, the planet would<span id = line_1575> [1575] </span>
<br>
start along a slightly advanced line, forming a new ellipse slightly in<span id = line_1576> [1576] </span>
<br>
advance of the first. The elliptic orbit slowly turns in the direction<span id = line_1577> [1577] </span>
<br>
in which the planet is moving. After many years--centuries--the orbit<span id = line_1578> [1578] </span>
<br>
will be in a different direction.<span id = line_1579> [1579] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1580> [1580] </span>
<br>
The rapidity of the orbit's change of direction depends on the velocity<span id = line_1581> [1581] </span>
<br>
of the planet. Mercury moving at the rate of 30 miles a second is the<span id = line_1582> [1582] </span>
<br>
fastest among the planets. It has the further advantage over Venus or<span id = line_1583> [1583] </span>
<br>
the earth in that its orbit, as we have said, is an ellipse, whereas<span id = line_1584> [1584] </span>
<br>
the orbits of Venus and the earth are nearly circular; and how are<span id = line_1585> [1585] </span>
<br>
you going to tell in which direction a circle is pointing?<span id = line_1586> [1586] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1587> [1587] </span>
<br>
Observation tells us that the orbit of Mercury is advancing at the<span id = line_1588> [1588] </span>
<br>
rate of 574 seconds (of arc) per century. We can calculate how much<span id = line_1589> [1589] </span>
<br>
of this is due to the gravitational influence of other planets. It<span id = line_1590> [1590] </span>
<br>
amounts to 532 seconds per century. What of the remaining 42 seconds?<span id = line_1591> [1591] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1592> [1592] </span>
<br>
You might be inclined to attribute this shortcoming to experimental<span id = line_1593> [1593] </span>
<br>
error. But when all such possibilities are allowed for our<span id = line_1594> [1594] </span>
<br>
mathematicians assure us that the discrepancy is 30 times greater<span id = line_1595> [1595] </span>
<br>
than any possible experimental error.<span id = line_1596> [1596] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1597> [1597] </span>
<br>
This discrepancy between theory and observation remained one<span id = line_1598> [1598] </span>
<br>
of the great puzzles in astronomy until Einstein cleared up the<span id = line_1599> [1599] </span>
<br>
mystery. According to Einstein's theory the mathematics of the<span id = line_1600> [1600] </span>
<br>
situation is simply this: in one revolution of the planet the orbit<span id = line_1601> [1601] </span>
<br>
will advance by a fraction of a revolution equal to three times the<span id = line_1602> [1602] </span>
<br>
square of the ratio of the velocity of the planet to the velocity<span id = line_1603> [1603] </span>
<br>
of light. When we allow mathematicians to work this out we get the<span id = line_1604> [1604] </span>
<br>
figure 43, which is certainly close enough to 42 to be called identical<span id = line_1605> [1605] </span>
<br>
with it.<span id = line_1606> [1606] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1607> [1607] </span>
<br>
Still Another Victory? Einstein's third prediction--the shifting of<span id = line_1608> [1608] </span>
<br>
spectral lines toward the red end of the spectrum in the case of light<span id = line_1609> [1609] </span>
<br>
coming to us from the stars of appreciable mass--seems to have been<span id = line_1610> [1610] </span>
<br>
confirmed recently (March, 1920). "The young physicists in Bonn,"<span id = line_1611> [1611] </span>
<br>
writes Prof. Einstein to a friend, "have now as good as certainty<span id = line_1612> [1612] </span>
<br>
(so gut wie sicher) proved the red displacement of the spectral lines<span id = line_1613> [1613] </span>
<br>
and have cleared up the grounds of a previous disappointment."<span id = line_1614> [1614] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1615> [1615] </span>
<br>
Summary. Velocity, or movement in space, is at the basis of Einstein's<span id = line_1616> [1616] </span>
<br>
work, as it was at the basis of Newton's. But time and space no<span id = line_1617> [1617] </span>
<br>
longer have the distinct meanings that they had when examined with<span id = line_1618> [1618] </span>
<br>
the help of Newton's equations. Time and space are not independent but<span id = line_1619> [1619] </span>
<br>
interdependent. They are meaningless when treated as separate entities,<span id = line_1620> [1620] </span>
<br>
giving results which may hold for one body in the universe but do not<span id = line_1621> [1621] </span>
<br>
hold for any other body. To get general laws which are applicable to<span id = line_1622> [1622] </span>
<br>
the cosmos as a whole the Fundamentals of Mechanics must be united.<span id = line_1623> [1623] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1624> [1624] </span>
<br>
Einstein's great achievement consists in applying this<span id = line_1625> [1625] </span>
<br>
revised conception of space and time to elucidate cosmical<span id = line_1626> [1626] </span>
<br>
problems. "World-lines," representing the progress of particles in<span id = line_1627> [1627] </span>
<br>
space, consisting of space-time combinations (the four dimensions),<span id = line_1628> [1628] </span>
<br>
are "strained" or "distorted" in space due to the attraction that<span id = line_1629> [1629] </span>
<br>
bodies exhibit for one another (the force of gravitation). On<span id = line_1630> [1630] </span>
<br>
the other hand, gravitation itself--more universal than anything<span id = line_1631> [1631] </span>
<br>
else in the universe--may be interpreted in terms of strains on<span id = line_1632> [1632] </span>
<br>
world-lines, or, what amounts to the same thing, strains of space-time<span id = line_1633> [1633] </span>
<br>
combinations. This brings gravitation within the field of Einstein's<span id = line_1634> [1634] </span>
<br>
conception of time and space.<span id = line_1635> [1635] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1636> [1636] </span>
<br>
That Einstein's conception of the universe is an improvement upon that<span id = line_1637> [1637] </span>
<br>
of Newton's is evidenced by the fact that Einstein's law explains all<span id = line_1638> [1638] </span>
<br>
that Newton's law does, and also other facts which Newton's law is<span id = line_1639> [1639] </span>
<br>
incapable of explaining. Among these may be mentioned the distortion<span id = line_1640> [1640] </span>
<br>
of the oval orbits of planets round the sun (confirmed in the case of<span id = line_1641> [1641] </span>
<br>
the planet Mercury), and the deviation of light rays in a gravitational<span id = line_1642> [1642] </span>
<br>
field (confirmed by the English Solar Eclipse Expedition).<span id = line_1643> [1643] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1644> [1644] </span>
<br>
Einstein's Theories and the Inferences to be Drawn from<span id = line_1645> [1645] </span>
<br>
Them. Einstein's theories, supported as they are by very convincing<span id = line_1646> [1646] </span>
<br>
experiments, will probably profoundly influence philosophic and<span id = line_1647> [1647] </span>
<br>
perhaps religious thought, but they can hardly be said to be of<span id = line_1648> [1648] </span>
<br>
immediate consequence to the man in the street. As I have said<span id = line_1649> [1649] </span>
<br>
elsewhere, Einstein's theories are not going to add one bushel of<span id = line_1650> [1650] </span>
<br>
wheat to war-torn and devastated Europe, but in their conception of<span id = line_1651> [1651] </span>
<br>
a cosmos decidedly at variance with anything yet conceived by any<span id = line_1652> [1652] </span>
<br>
school of philosophy, they will attract the universal attention of<span id = line_1653> [1653] </span>
<br>
thinking men in all countries. The scientist is immediately struck<span id = line_1654> [1654] </span>
<br>
by the way Einstein has utilized the various achievements in physics<span id = line_1655> [1655] </span>
<br>
and mathematics to build up a co-ordinated system showing connecting<span id = line_1656> [1656] </span>
<br>
links where heretofore none were perceived. The philosopher is equally<span id = line_1657> [1657] </span>
<br>
fascinated with a theory, which, in detail extremely complex, shows<span id = line_1658> [1658] </span>
<br>
a singular beauty of unity in design when viewed as a whole. The<span id = line_1659> [1659] </span>
<br>
revolutionary ideas propounded regarding time and space, the brilliant<span id = line_1660> [1660] </span>
<br>
way in which the most universal property of matter, gravitation,<span id = line_1661> [1661] </span>
<br>
is for the first time linked up with other properties of matter,<span id = line_1662> [1662] </span>
<br>
and, above all, the experimental confirmation of several of his<span id = line_1663> [1663] </span>
<br>
more startling predictions--always the finest test of scientific<span id = line_1664> [1664] </span>
<br>
merit--stamps Einstein as one of those super-men who from time to<span id = line_1665> [1665] </span>

<br>
Some Facts about Einstein Himself. Albert Einstein was born in Germany<span id = line_1668> [1668] </span>
<br>
some 45 years ago. At first he was engaged at the Patent Bureau in<span id = line_1669> [1669] </span>
<br>
Berne, and later became professor at the Zürich Polytechnic. After<span id = line_1670> [1670] </span>
<br>
a short stay at Prague University he accepted one of those tempting<span id = line_1671> [1671] </span>
<br>
"Akademiker" professorships at the university of Berlin--professorships<span id = line_1672> [1672] </span>
<br>
which insure a comfortable income to the recipient of one of them,<span id = line_1673> [1673] </span>
<br>
little university work beyond, perhaps, one lecture a week, and<span id = line_1674> [1674] </span>
<br>
splendid facilities for research. A similar inducement enticed the<span id = line_1675> [1675] </span>
<br>
chemical philosopher, Van 't Hoff, to leave his Amsterdam, and the<span id = line_1676> [1676] </span>
<br>
Swedes came perilously near losing their most illustrious scientist,<span id = line_1677> [1677] </span>
<br>
Arrhenius.<span id = line_1678> [1678] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1679> [1679] </span>
<br>
Einstein published his first paper on relativity in 1905, when not<span id = line_1680> [1680] </span>
<br>
more than 30 years old. Of this paper Planck, the Nobel Laureate<span id = line_1681> [1681] </span>
<br>
in physics this year, has offered this opinion: "It surpasses in<span id = line_1682> [1682] </span>
<br>
boldness everything previously suggested in speculative natural<span id = line_1683> [1683] </span>
<br>
philosophy and even in the philosophical theories of knowledge. The<span id = line_1684> [1684] </span>
<br>
revolution introduced into the physical conceptions of the world is<span id = line_1685> [1685] </span>
<br>
only to be compared in extent and depth with that brought about by<span id = line_1686> [1686] </span>

<br>
During the momentous years of 1914-19, Einstein quietly pursued his<span id = line_1691> [1691] </span>
<br>
labors. There seems to be some foundation for the belief that the ways<span id = line_1692> [1692] </span>
<br>
of the German High Command found little favor in his eyes. At any<span id = line_1693> [1693] </span>
<br>
rate, he was not one of the forty professors who signed the famous<span id = line_1694> [1694] </span>
<br>
manifesto extolling Germany's aims. "We know for a fact," writes<span id = line_1695> [1695] </span>
<br>
Dr. O. A. Rankine, of the Imperial College of Science and Technology,<span id = line_1696> [1696] </span>
<br>

<br>
have been Germany's mistakes in other directions, she left her men<span id = line_1698> [1698] </span>
<br>
of science severely alone. In fact, they were encouraged to continue<span id = line_1699> [1699] </span>
<br>
in their normal occupations. Einstein undoubtedly received a large<span id = line_1700> [1700] </span>
<br>
measure of support from the Imperial Government, even when the German<span id = line_1701> [1701] </span>

Quite recently (June, 1920) the Barnard Medal of Columbia University<span id = line_1704> [1704] </span>
<br>
was conferred on him "in recognition of his highly original<span id = line_1705> [1705] </span>
<br>
and fruitful development of the fundamental concepts of physics<span id = line_1706> [1706] </span>
<br>
through application of mathematics." In acknowledging the honor,<span id = line_1707> [1707] </span>
<br>
Prof. Einstein wrote to President Butler that "... quite apart from<span id = line_1708> [1708] </span>

Huyghens and Leibniz both objected to Newton's inverse square law<span id = line_1802> [1802] </span>
<br>
because it postulated "action at a distance,"--for example, the<span id = line_1803> [1803] </span>
<br>
attractive force of the sun and the earth. This desire for "continuity"<span id = line_1804> [1804] </span>
<br>
in physical laws led to the supposition of an "ether." We may here<span id = line_1805> [1805] </span>
<br>
anticipate and state that the reason which prompted Huyghens to object<span id = line_1806> [1806] </span>
<br>
to Newton's law led Einstein in our own day to raise objections to<span id = line_1807> [1807] </span>
<br>
the "ether" theory. "In the formulation of physical laws, only those<span id = line_1808> [1808] </span>
<br>
things were to be regarded as being in causal connection which were<span id = line_1809> [1809] </span>
<br>
capable of being actually observed." And the "ether" has not been<span id = line_1810> [1810] </span>
<br>
"actually observed."<span id = line_1811> [1811] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1812> [1812] </span>
<br>
The idea of "continuity" implies distances between adjacent points<span id = line_1813> [1813] </span>
<br>
that are infinitesimal in extent; hence the idea of "continuity"<span id = line_1814> [1814] </span>
<br>
comes in direct opposition with the finite distances of Newton.<span id = line_1815> [1815] </span>

<br>
The statement relating to causal connection--the refusal to accept an<span id = line_1817> [1817] </span>

"ether" as an absolute base of reference--leads to the principle of<span id = line_1818> [1818] </span>

Sir Oliver Lodge goes to the extreme of pinning his faith in the<span id = line_1825> [1825] </span>
<br>
reality of this ether rather than in that of matter. Witness the<span id = line_1826> [1826] </span>
<br>
following statement he made recently before a New York audience:<span id = line_1827> [1827] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1828> [1828] </span>
<br>
"To my mind the ether of space is a substantial reality with<span id = line_1829> [1829] </span>
<br>
extraordinarily perfect properties, with an immense amount of energy<span id = line_1830> [1830] </span>
<br>
stored up in it, with a constitution which we must discover, but a<span id = line_1831> [1831] </span>
<br>
substantial reality far more impressive than that of matter. Empty<span id = line_1832> [1832] </span>
<br>
space, as we call it, is full of ether, but it makes no appeal to<span id = line_1833> [1833] </span>
<br>
our senses. The appearance is as if it were nothing. It is the most<span id = line_1834> [1834] </span>
<br>
important thing in the material universe. I believe that matter<span id = line_1835> [1835] </span>
<br>
is a modification of ether, a very porous substance, a thing more<span id = line_1836> [1836] </span>
<br>
analogous to a cobweb or the Milky Way or something very slight and<span id = line_1837> [1837] </span>
<br>
unsubstantial, as compared to ether."<span id = line_1838> [1838] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1839> [1839] </span>
<br>
And again:<span id = line_1840> [1840] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1841> [1841] </span>
<br>
"The properties of ether seem to be perfect. Matter is less so; it has<span id = line_1842> [1842] </span>
<br>
friction and elasticity. No imperfection has been discovered in the<span id = line_1843> [1843] </span>
<br>
ether space. It doesn't wear out; there is no dissipation of energy;<span id = line_1844> [1844] </span>
<br>
there is no friction. Ether is material, yet it is not matter; both<span id = line_1845> [1845] </span>
<br>
are substantial realities in physics, but it is the ether of space<span id = line_1846> [1846] </span>
<br>
that holds things together and acts as a cement. My business is to<span id = line_1847> [1847] </span>
<br>
call attention to the whole world of etherealness of things, and I<span id = line_1848> [1848] </span>
<br>
have made it a subject of thirty years' study, but we must admit that<span id = line_1849> [1849] </span>
<br>
there is no getting hold of ether except indirectly."<span id = line_1850> [1850] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1851> [1851] </span>
<br>
"I consider the ether of space," says Lodge, in conclusion, "the one<span id = line_1852> [1852] </span>
<br>
substantial thing in the universe." And Lodge is certainly entitled<span id = line_1853> [1853] </span>
<br>
to his opinion.<span id = line_1854> [1854] </span>

<br>
For the benefit of those readers who wish to gain a deeper insight<span id = line_1860> [1860] </span>
<br>
into the relativity principle, we shall here discuss it very briefly.<span id = line_1861> [1861] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1862> [1862] </span>
<br>
Newton and Galileo had developed a relativity principle in mechanics<span id = line_1863> [1863] </span>
<br>
which may be stated as follows: If one system of reference is in<span id = line_1864> [1864] </span>
<br>
uniform rectilinear motion with respect to another system of reference,<span id = line_1865> [1865] </span>
<br>
then whatever physical laws are deduced from the first system hold<span id = line_1866> [1866] </span>
<br>
true for the second system. The two systems are equivalent. If the<span id = line_1867> [1867] </span>
<br>
two systems be represented by $xyz$ and $x'y'z'$, and if they move<span id = line_1868> [1868] </span>
<br>
with the velocity of v along the x-axis with respect to one another,<span id = line_1869> [1869] </span>
<br>
then the two systems are mathematically related thus:<span id = line_1870> [1870] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1871> [1871] </span>
<br>
    $$x' = x - vt, y' = y, z' = z, t' = t,$$<span id = line_1872> [1872] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1873> [1873] </span>
<br>
and this immediately provides us with a means of transforming the<span id = line_1874> [1874] </span>
<br>
laws of one system to those of another.<span id = line_1875> [1875] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1876> [1876] </span>
<br>
With the development of electrodynamics (which we may call electricity<span id = line_1877> [1877] </span>
<br>
in motion) difficulties arose which equations in mechanics of type<span id = line_1878> [1878] </span>
<br>
(1) could no longer solve. These difficulties merely increased when<span id = line_1879> [1879] </span>
<br>
Maxwell showed that light must be regarded as an electromagnetic<span id = line_1880> [1880] </span>
<br>
phenomenon. For suppose we wish to investigate the motion of a source<span id = line_1881> [1881] </span>
<br>
of light (which may be the equivalent of the motion of the earth<span id = line_1882> [1882] </span>
<br>
with reference to the sun) with respect to the velocity of the light<span id = line_1883> [1883] </span>
<br>
it emits--a typical example of the study of moving systems--how are<span id = line_1884> [1884] </span>
<br>
we to coordinate the electrodynamical and mechanical elements? Or,<span id = line_1885> [1885] </span>
<br>
again, suppose we wish to investigate the velocity of electrons shot<span id = line_1886> [1886] </span>
<br>
out from radium with a speed comparable to that of light, how are we<span id = line_1887> [1887] </span>
<br>
to coordinate the two branches in tracing the course of these negative<span id = line_1888> [1888] </span>
<br>
particles of electricity?<span id = line_1889> [1889] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1890> [1890] </span>
<br>
It was difficulties such as these that led to the Lorentz-Einstein<span id = line_1891> [1891] </span>
<br>
modifications of the Newton-Galileo relativity equations (1). The<span id = line_1892> [1892] </span>
<br>
Lorentz-Einstein equations are expressed in the form:<span id = line_1893> [1893] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1894> [1894] </span>
<br>
$$x' = \frac{x-vt}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c}}}, y' = y, z' = z, t' =<span id = line_1895> [1895] </span>
<br>
\frac{t-\frac{v}{c^2}\cdot x}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}},$$<span id = line_1896> [1896] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1897> [1897] </span>
<br>
c denoting the velocity of light in vacuo (which, according to all<span id = line_1898> [1898] </span>
<br>
observations, is the same, irrespective of the observer's state of<span id = line_1899> [1899] </span>
<br>
motion). Here, you see, electrodynamical systems (light and therefore<span id = line_1900> [1900] </span>
<br>
"ray" velocities such as those due to electrons) are brought into play.<span id = line_1901> [1901] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1902> [1902] </span>
<br>
This gives us Einstein's special theory of relativity. From it Einstein<span id = line_1903> [1903] </span>
<br>
deduced some startling conceptions of time and space.<span id = line_1904> [1904] </span>

<br>
The velocity (v) of an object in one system will have a different<span id = line_1910> [1910] </span>
<br>
velocity (v') if referred to another system in uniform motion relative<span id = line_1911> [1911] </span>
<br>
to the first. It had been supposed that only a "something" endowed<span id = line_1912> [1912] </span>
<br>
with infinite velocity would show the same velocity in all systems,<span id = line_1913> [1913] </span>
<br>
irrespective of the motions of the latter. Michelson and Morley's<span id = line_1914> [1914] </span>
<br>
results actually point to the velocity of light as showing the<span id = line_1915> [1915] </span>
<br>
properties of the imaginary "infinite velocity." The velocity of<span id = line_1916> [1916] </span>
<br>
light possesses universal significance; and this is the basis for<span id = line_1917> [1917] </span>
<br>
much of Einstein's earlier work.<span id = line_1918> [1918] </span>

"Euclid assumes that parallel lines never meet, which they cannot<span id = line_1924> [1924] </span>
<br>
do of course if they be defined as equidistant. But are there such<span id = line_1925> [1925] </span>
<br>
lines? And if not, why not assume that all lines drawn through a<span id = line_1926> [1926] </span>
<br>
point outside a given line will eventually intersect it? Such an<span id = line_1927> [1927] </span>
<br>
assumption leads to a geometry in which all lines are conceived as<span id = line_1928> [1928] </span>
<br>

Einstein had become tired of assumptions. He had no particular<span id = line_1941> [1941] </span>
<br>
objection to the "ether" theory beyond the fact that this "ether"<span id = line_1942> [1942] </span>
<br>
did not come within the range of our senses; it could not be<span id = line_1943> [1943] </span>

"observed." "The consistent fulfilment of the two postulates--'action<span id = line_1944> [1944] </span>

<br>
as lie within the realm of observation [see Note 2] combined<span id = line_1946> [1946] </span>

<br>
That the conception of the "simultaneity" of events is devoid of<span id = line_1955> [1955] </span>
<br>
meaning can be deduced from equation (2) [see Note 4]. We owe the proof<span id = line_1956> [1956] </span>
<br>
to Einstein. "It is possible to select a suitable time-coordinate<span id = line_1957> [1957] </span>
<br>
in such a way that a time-measurement enters into physical laws<span id = line_1958> [1958] </span>
<br>
in exactly the same manner as regards its significance as a space<span id = line_1959> [1959] </span>
<br>
measurement (that is, they are fully equivalent symbolically), and<span id = line_1960> [1960] </span>
<br>
has likewise a definite coordinate direction.... It never occurred to<span id = line_1961> [1961] </span>
<br>
anyone that the use of a light-signal as a means of connection between<span id = line_1962> [1962] </span>
<br>
the moving-body and the observer, which is necessary in practice in<span id = line_1963> [1963] </span>
<br>
order to determine simultaneity, might affect the final result, i.e.,<span id = line_1964> [1964] </span>
<br>
of time measurements in different systems." (Freundlich). But that<span id = line_1965> [1965] </span>
<br>
is just what Einstein shows, because time-measurements are based on<span id = line_1966> [1966] </span>
<br>
"simultaneity of events," and this, as pointed out above, is devoid<span id = line_1967> [1967] </span>

as the velocity of light, rather than relatively small ones--and even<span id = line_1971> [1971] </span>

the velocity of the earth around the sun is small as compared to the<span id = line_1972> [1972] </span>

How the special theory of relativity (see Note 4) led to the general<span id = line_1980> [1980] </span>
<br>
theory of relativity (which included gravitation) may now be briefly<span id = line_1981> [1981] </span>

<br>
<span id = line_1983> [1983] </span>
<br>
When we speak of electrons, or negative particles of electricity,<span id = line_1984> [1984] </span>
<br>
in motion, we are speaking of energy in motion. Now these electrons<span id = line_1985> [1985] </span>
<br>
when in motion exhibit properties that are very similar to matter in<span id = line_1986> [1986] </span>
<br>
motion. Whatever deviations there are are due to the enormous velocity<span id = line_1987> [1987] </span>
<br>
of these electrons, and this velocity, as has already been pointed<span id = line_1988> [1988] </span>
<br>
out, is comparable to that of light; whereas before the advent of the<span id = line_1989> [1989] </span>
<br>
electron, the velocity of no particles comparable to that of light<span id = line_1990> [1990] </span>

had ever been measured.<span id = line_1991> [1991] </span>

<span id = line_1992> [1992] </span>
<br>
According to present views "all inertia of matter consists only of the<span id = line_1993> [1993] </span>
<br>
inertia of the latent energy in it; ... everything that we know of the<span id = line_1994> [1994] </span>
<br>
inertia of energy holds without exception for the inertia of matter."<span id = line_1995> [1995] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_1996> [1996] </span>
<br>
Now it is on the assumption that inertial mass and gravitational<span id = line_1997> [1997] </span>
<br>
"pull" are equivalent that the mass of a body is determined by its<span id = line_1998> [1998] </span>
<br>
weight. What is true of matter should be true of energy.<span id = line_1999> [1999] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2000> [2000] </span>
<br>
The special theory of relativity, however, takes into account only<span id = line_2001> [2001] </span>
<br>
inertia ("inertial mass") but not gravitation (gravitational pull or<span id = line_2002> [2002] </span>
<br>
weight) of energy. When a body absorbs energy equation 2 (see Note 4)<span id = line_2003> [2003] </span>
<br>
will record a gain in inertia but not in weight--which is contrary<span id = line_2004> [2004] </span>
<br>
to one of the fundamental facts in mechanics.<span id = line_2005> [2005] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2006> [2006] </span>
<br>
This means that a more general theory of relativity is required to<span id = line_2007> [2007] </span>
<br>
include gravitational phenomena. Hence Einstein's General Theory of<span id = line_2008> [2008] </span>
<br>
Relativity. Hence the approach to a new theory of gravitation. Hence<span id = line_2009> [2009] </span>
<br>
"the setting up of a differential equation which comprises the<span id = line_2010> [2010] </span>
<br>
motion of a body under the influence of both inertia and gravity,<span id = line_2011> [2011] </span>
<br>
and which symbolically expresses the relativity of motions.... The<span id = line_2012> [2012] </span>
<br>
differential law must always preserve the same form, irrespective of<span id = line_2013> [2013] </span>
<br>
the system of coordinates to which it is referred, so that no system of<span id = line_2014> [2014] </span>
<br>
coordinates enjoys a preference to any other." (For the general form<span id = line_2015> [2015] </span>

of the equation and for an excellent discussion of its significance,<span id = line_2016> [2016] </span>

<span id = line_2027> [2027] </span>

<br>
<span id = line_2029> [2029] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2030> [2030] </span>
<br>
There are several kinds of theory in physics. Most of them are<span id = line_2031> [2031] </span>
<br>
constructive. These attempt to build a picture of complex phenomena out<span id = line_2032> [2032] </span>
<br>
of some relatively simple proposition. The kinetic theory of gases,<span id = line_2033> [2033] </span>
<br>
for instance, attempts to refer to molecular movement the mechanical<span id = line_2034> [2034] </span>
<br>
thermal, and diffusional properties of gases. When we say that we<span id = line_2035> [2035] </span>
<br>
understand a group of natural phenomena, we mean that we have found<span id = line_2036> [2036] </span>
<br>
a constructive theory which embraces them.<span id = line_2037> [2037] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2038> [2038] </span>
<br>
Theories of Principle.--But in addition to this most weighty group of<span id = line_2039> [2039] </span>
<br>
theories, there is another group consisting of what I call theories of<span id = line_2040> [2040] </span>
<br>
principle. These employ the analytic, not the synthetic method. Their<span id = line_2041> [2041] </span>
<br>
starting-point and foundation are not hypothetical constituents, but<span id = line_2042> [2042] </span>
<br>
empirically observed general properties of phenomena, principles from<span id = line_2043> [2043] </span>
<br>
which mathematical formulæ are deduced of such a kind that they apply<span id = line_2044> [2044] </span>
<br>
to every case which presents itself. Thermodynamics, for instance,<span id = line_2045> [2045] </span>
<br>
starting from the fact that perpetual motion never occurs in ordinary<span id = line_2046> [2046] </span>
<br>
experience, attempts to deduce from this, by analytic processes,<span id = line_2047> [2047] </span>
<br>
a theory which will apply in every case. The merit of constructive<span id = line_2048> [2048] </span>
<br>
theories is their comprehensiveness, adaptability, and clarity,<span id = line_2049> [2049] </span>
<br>
that of the theories of principle, their logical perfection, and the<span id = line_2050> [2050] </span>
<br>
security of their foundation.<span id = line_2051> [2051] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2052> [2052] </span>
<br>
The theory of relativity is a theory of principle. To understand it,<span id = line_2053> [2053] </span>
<br>
the principles on which it rests must be grasped. But before stating<span id = line_2054> [2054] </span>
<br>
these it is necessary to point out that the theory of relativity is<span id = line_2055> [2055] </span>
<br>
like a house with two separate stories, the special relativity theory<span id = line_2056> [2056] </span>
<br>
and the general theory of relativity.<span id = line_2057> [2057] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2058> [2058] </span>
<br>
Since the time of the ancient Greeks it has been well known that in<span id = line_2059> [2059] </span>
<br>
describing the motion of a body we must refer to another body. The<span id = line_2060> [2060] </span>
<br>
motion of a railway train is described with reference to the ground,<span id = line_2061> [2061] </span>
<br>
of a planet with reference to the total assemblage of visible fixed<span id = line_2062> [2062] </span>
<br>
stars. In physics the bodies to which motions are spatially referred<span id = line_2063> [2063] </span>
<br>
are termed systems of coordinates. The laws of mechanics of Galileo<span id = line_2064> [2064] </span>
<br>
and Newton can be formulated only by using a system of coordinates.<span id = line_2065> [2065] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2066> [2066] </span>
<br>
The state of motion of a system of coordinates can not be chosen<span id = line_2067> [2067] </span>
<br>
arbitrarily if the laws of mechanics are to hold good (it must be<span id = line_2068> [2068] </span>
<br>
free from twisting and from acceleration). The system of coordinates<span id = line_2069> [2069] </span>
<br>
employed in mechanics is called an inertia-system. The state of<span id = line_2070> [2070] </span>
<br>
motion of an inertia-system, so far as mechanics are concerned,<span id = line_2071> [2071] </span>
<br>
is not restricted by nature to one condition. The condition in the<span id = line_2072> [2072] </span>
<br>
following proposition suffices; a system of coordinates moving in the<span id = line_2073> [2073] </span>
<br>
same direction and at the same rate as a system of inertia is itself<span id = line_2074> [2074] </span>
<br>
a system of inertia. The special relativity theory is therefore the<span id = line_2075> [2075] </span>
<br>
application of the following proposition to any natural process:<span id = line_2076> [2076] </span>
<br>
"Every law of nature which holds good with respect to a coordinate<span id = line_2077> [2077] </span>
<br>
system K must also hold good for any other system K' provided that<span id = line_2078> [2078] </span>
<br>
K and K' are in uniform movement of translation."<span id = line_2079> [2079] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2080> [2080] </span>
<br>
The second principle on which the special relativity theory rests is<span id = line_2081> [2081] </span>
<br>
that of the constancy of the velocity of light in a vacuum. Light<span id = line_2082> [2082] </span>
<br>
in a vacuum has a definite and constant velocity, independent of<span id = line_2083> [2083] </span>
<br>
the velocity of its source. Physicists owe their confidence in this<span id = line_2084> [2084] </span>
<br>
proposition to the Maxwell-Lorentz theory of electro-dynamics.<span id = line_2085> [2085] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2086> [2086] </span>
<br>
The two principles which I have mentioned have received strong<span id = line_2087> [2087] </span>
<br>
experimental confirmation, but do not seem to be logically<span id = line_2088> [2088] </span>
<br>
compatible. The special relativity theory achieved their logical<span id = line_2089> [2089] </span>
<br>
reconciliation by making a change in kinematics, that is to say,<span id = line_2090> [2090] </span>
<br>
in the doctrine of the physical laws of space and time. It became<span id = line_2091> [2091] </span>
<br>
evident that a statement of the coincidence of two events could have<span id = line_2092> [2092] </span>
<br>
a meaning only in connection with a system of coordinates, that the<span id = line_2093> [2093] </span>
<br>
mass of bodies and the rate of movement of clocks must depend on<span id = line_2094> [2094] </span>
<br>
their state of motion with regard to the coordinates.<span id = line_2095> [2095] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2096> [2096] </span>
<br>
The Older Physics.--But the older physics, including the laws of<span id = line_2097> [2097] </span>
<br>
motion of Galileo and Newton, clashed with the relativistic kinematics<span id = line_2098> [2098] </span>
<br>
that I have indicated. The latter gave origin to certain generalized<span id = line_2099> [2099] </span>
<br>
mathematical conditions with which the laws of nature would have to<span id = line_2100> [2100] </span>
<br>
conform if the two fundamental principles were compatible. Physics had<span id = line_2101> [2101] </span>
<br>
to be modified. The most notable change was a new law of motion for<span id = line_2102> [2102] </span>
<br>
(very rapidly) moving mass-points, and this soon came to be verified<span id = line_2103> [2103] </span>
<br>
in the case of electrically-laden particles. The most important result<span id = line_2104> [2104] </span>
<br>
of the special relativity system concerned the inert mass of a material<span id = line_2105> [2105] </span>
<br>
system. It became evident that the inertia of such a system must depend<span id = line_2106> [2106] </span>
<br>
on its energy-content, so that we were driven to the conception that<span id = line_2107> [2107] </span>
<br>
inert mass was nothing else than latent energy. The doctrine of the<span id = line_2108> [2108] </span>
<br>
conservation of mass lost its independence and became merged in the<span id = line_2109> [2109] </span>
<br>
doctrine of conservation of energy.<span id = line_2110> [2110] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2111> [2111] </span>
<br>
The special relativity theory which was simply a systematic extension<span id = line_2112> [2112] </span>
<br>
of the electro-dynamics of Maxwell and Lorentz, had consequences which<span id = line_2113> [2113] </span>
<br>
reached beyond itself. Must the independence of physical laws with<span id = line_2114> [2114] </span>
<br>
regard to a system of coordinates be limited to systems of coordinates<span id = line_2115> [2115] </span>
<br>
in uniform movement of translation with regard to one another? What has<span id = line_2116> [2116] </span>
<br>
nature to do with the coordinate systems that we propose and with their<span id = line_2117> [2117] </span>
<br>
motions? Although it may be necessary for our descriptions of nature<span id = line_2118> [2118] </span>
<br>
to employ systems of coordinates that we have selected arbitrarily,<span id = line_2119> [2119] </span>
<br>
the choice should not be limited in any way so far as their state of<span id = line_2120> [2120] </span>
<br>
motion is concerned. (General theory of relativity.) The application<span id = line_2121> [2121] </span>
<br>
of this general theory of relativity was found to be in conflict<span id = line_2122> [2122] </span>
<br>
with a well-known experiment, according to which it appeared that<span id = line_2123> [2123] </span>
<br>
the weight and the inertia of a body depended on the same constants<span id = line_2124> [2124] </span>
<br>
(identity of inert and heavy masses). Consider the case of a system of<span id = line_2125> [2125] </span>
<br>
coordinates which is conceived as being in stable rotation relative<span id = line_2126> [2126] </span>
<br>
to a system of inertia in the Newtonian sense. The forces which,<span id = line_2127> [2127] </span>
<br>
relatively to this system, are centrifugal must, in the Newtonian<span id = line_2128> [2128] </span>
<br>
sense, be attributed to inertia. But these centrifugal forces are,<span id = line_2129> [2129] </span>
<br>
like gravitation, proportional to the mass of the bodies. Is it not,<span id = line_2130> [2130] </span>
<br>
then, possible to regard the system of coordinates as at rest, and<span id = line_2131> [2131] </span>
<br>
the centrifugal forces as gravitational? The interpretation seemed<span id = line_2132> [2132] </span>
<br>
obvious, but classical mechanics forbade it.<span id = line_2133> [2133] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2134> [2134] </span>
<br>
This slight sketch indicates how a generalized theory of relativity<span id = line_2135> [2135] </span>
<br>
must include the laws of gravitation, and actual pursuit of the<span id = line_2136> [2136] </span>
<br>
conception has justified the hope. But the way was harder than<span id = line_2137> [2137] </span>
<br>
was expected, because it contradicted Euclidian geometry. In other<span id = line_2138> [2138] </span>
<br>
words, the laws according to which material bodies are arranged in<span id = line_2139> [2139] </span>
<br>
space do not exactly agree with the laws of space prescribed by the<span id = line_2140> [2140] </span>
<br>
Euclidian geometry of solids. This is what is meant by the phrase<span id = line_2141> [2141] </span>
<br>
"a warp in space." The fundamental concepts "straight," "plane,"<span id = line_2142> [2142] </span>
<br>
etc., accordingly lose their exact meaning in physics.<span id = line_2143> [2143] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2144> [2144] </span>
<br>
In the generalized theory of relativity, the doctrine of space and<span id = line_2145> [2145] </span>
<br>
time, kinematics, is no longer one of the absolute foundations of<span id = line_2146> [2146] </span>
<br>
general physics. The geometrical states of bodies and the rates<span id = line_2147> [2147] </span>
<br>
of clocks depend in the first place on their gravitational fields,<span id = line_2148> [2148] </span>
<br>
which again are produced by the material system concerned.<span id = line_2149> [2149] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2150> [2150] </span>
<br>
Thus the new theory of gravitation diverges widely from that of Newton<span id = line_2151> [2151] </span>
<br>
with respect to its basal principle. But in practical application<span id = line_2152> [2152] </span>
<br>
the two agree so closely that it has been difficult to find cases in<span id = line_2153> [2153] </span>
<br>
which the actual differences could be subjected to observation. As<span id = line_2154> [2154] </span>
<br>
yet only the following have been suggested:<span id = line_2155> [2155] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2156> [2156] </span>
<br>
1. The distortion of the oval orbits of planets round the sun<span id = line_2157> [2157] </span>
<br>
(confirmed in the case of the planet Mercury).<span id = line_2158> [2158] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2159> [2159] </span>
<br>
2. The deviation of light-rays in a gravitational field (confirmed<span id = line_2160> [2160] </span>
<br>
by the English Solar Eclipse expedition).<span id = line_2161> [2161] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2162> [2162] </span>
<br>
3. The shifting of spectral lines towards the red end of the spectrum<span id = line_2163> [2163] </span>
<br>
in the case of light coming to us from stars of appreciable mass<span id = line_2164> [2164] </span>
<br>
(not yet confirmed).<span id = line_2165> [2165] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2166> [2166] </span>
<br>
The great attraction of the theory is its logical consistency. If<span id = line_2167> [2167] </span>
<br>
any deduction from it should prove untenable, it must be given up. A<span id = line_2168> [2168] </span>
<br>
modification of it seems impossible without destruction of the whole.<span id = line_2169> [2169] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2170> [2170] </span>
<br>
No one must think that Newton's great creation can be overthrown in<span id = line_2171> [2171] </span>
<br>
any real sense by this or by any other theory. His clear and wide<span id = line_2172> [2172] </span>
<br>
ideas will for ever retain their significance as the foundation on<span id = line_2173> [2173] </span>
<br>
which our modern conceptions of physics have been built.<span id = line_2174> [2174] </span>

EINSTEIN'S LAW OF GRAVITATION [15]<span id = line_2183> [2183] </span>

<span id = line_2184> [2184] </span>
<br>
By Prof. J. S. Ames<span id = line_2185> [2185] </span>

Johns Hopkins University<span id = line_2186> [2186] </span>

<br>
... In the treatment of Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic<span id = line_2189> [2189] </span>
<br>
field, several investigators realized the importance of deducing the<span id = line_2190> [2190] </span>
<br>
form of the equations when applied to a system moving with a uniform<span id = line_2191> [2191] </span>
<br>
velocity. One object of such an investigation would be to determine<span id = line_2192> [2192] </span>
<br>
such a set of transformation formulæ as would leave the mathematical<span id = line_2193> [2193] </span>
<br>
form of the equations unaltered. The necessary relations between<span id = line_2194> [2194] </span>
<br>
the new space-coordinates, those applying to the moving system,<span id = line_2195> [2195] </span>
<br>
and the original set were of course obvious; and elementary methods<span id = line_2196> [2196] </span>
<br>
led to the deduction of a new variable which should replace the time<span id = line_2197> [2197] </span>
<br>
coordinate. This step was taken by Lorentz and also, I believe, by<span id = line_2198> [2198] </span>
<br>
Larmor and by Voigt. The mathematical deductions and applications<span id = line_2199> [2199] </span>
<br>
in the hands of these men were extremely beautiful, and are probably<span id = line_2200> [2200] </span>
<br>
well known to you all.<span id = line_2201> [2201] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2202> [2202] </span>
<br>
Lorentz' paper on this subject appeared in the Proceedings of the<span id = line_2203> [2203] </span>
<br>
Amsterdam Academy in 1904. In the following year there was published<span id = line_2204> [2204] </span>
<br>
in the Annalen der Physik a paper by Einstein, written without any<span id = line_2205> [2205] </span>
<br>
knowledge of the work of Lorentz, in which he arrived at the same<span id = line_2206> [2206] </span>
<br>
transformation equations as did the latter, but with an entirely<span id = line_2207> [2207] </span>
<br>
different and fundamentally new interpretation. Einstein called<span id = line_2208> [2208] </span>
<br>
attention in his paper to the lack of definiteness in the concepts<span id = line_2209> [2209] </span>
<br>
of time and space, as ordinarily stated and used. He analyzed clearly<span id = line_2210> [2210] </span>
<br>
the definitions and postulates which were necessary before one could<span id = line_2211> [2211] </span>
<br>
speak with exactness of a length or of an interval of time. He disposed<span id = line_2212> [2212] </span>
<br>
forever of the propriety of speaking of the "true" length of a rod or<span id = line_2213> [2213] </span>
<br>
of the "true" duration of time, showing, in fact, that the numerical<span id = line_2214> [2214] </span>
<br>
values which we attach to lengths or intervals of time depend upon the<span id = line_2215> [2215] </span>
<br>
definitions and postulates which we adopt. The words "absolute" space<span id = line_2216> [2216] </span>
<br>
or time intervals are devoid of meaning. As an illustration of what<span id = line_2217> [2217] </span>
<br>
is meant Einstein discussed two possible ways of measuring the length<span id = line_2218> [2218] </span>
<br>
of a rod when it is moving in the direction of its own length with<span id = line_2219> [2219] </span>
<br>
a uniform velocity, that is, after having adopted a scale of length,<span id = line_2220> [2220] </span>
<br>
two ways of assigning a number to the length of the rod concerned. One<span id = line_2221> [2221] </span>
<br>
method is to imagine the observer moving with the rod, applying along<span id = line_2222> [2222] </span>
<br>
its length the measuring scale, and reading off the positions of the<span id = line_2223> [2223] </span>
<br>
ends of the rod. Another method would be to have two observers at rest<span id = line_2224> [2224] </span>
<br>
on the body with reference to which the rod has the uniform velocity,<span id = line_2225> [2225] </span>
<br>
so stationed along the line of motion of the rod that as the rod<span id = line_2226> [2226] </span>
<br>
moves past them they can note simultaneously on a stationary measuring<span id = line_2227> [2227] </span>
<br>
scale the positions of the two ends of the rod. Einstein showed that,<span id = line_2228> [2228] </span>
<br>
accepting two postulates which need no defense at this time, the two<span id = line_2229> [2229] </span>
<br>
methods of measurements would lead to different numerical values, and,<span id = line_2230> [2230] </span>
<br>
further, that the divergence of the two results would increase as the<span id = line_2231> [2231] </span>
<br>
velocity of the rod was increased. In assigning a number, therefore,<span id = line_2232> [2232] </span>
<br>
to the length of a moving rod, one must make a choice of the method to<span id = line_2233> [2233] </span>
<br>
be used in measuring it. Obviously the preferable method is to agree<span id = line_2234> [2234] </span>
<br>
that the observer shall move with the rod, carrying his measuring<span id = line_2235> [2235] </span>
<br>
instrument with him. This disposes of the problem of measuring space<span id = line_2236> [2236] </span>
<br>
relations. The observed fact that, if we measure the length of the rod<span id = line_2237> [2237] </span>
<br>
on different days, or when the rod is lying in different positions,<span id = line_2238> [2238] </span>
<br>
we always obtain the same value offers no information concerning the<span id = line_2239> [2239] </span>
<br>
"real" length of the rod. It may have changed, or it may not. It<span id = line_2240> [2240] </span>
<br>
must always be remembered that measurement of the length of a<span id = line_2241> [2241] </span>
<br>
rod is simply a process of comparison between it and an arbitrary<span id = line_2242> [2242] </span>
<br>
standard, e.g., a meter-rod or yard-stick. In regard to the problem<span id = line_2243> [2243] </span>
<br>
of assigning numbers to intervals of time, it must be borne in mind<span id = line_2244> [2244] </span>
<br>
that, strictly speaking, we do not "measure" such intervals, i.e.,<span id = line_2245> [2245] </span>
<br>
that we do not select a unit interval of time and find how many times<span id = line_2246> [2246] </span>
<br>
it is contained in the interval in question. (Similarly, we do not<span id = line_2247> [2247] </span>
<br>
"measure" the pitch of a sound or the temperature of a room.) Our<span id = line_2248> [2248] </span>
<br>
practical instruments for assigning numbers to time-intervals depend<span id = line_2249> [2249] </span>
<br>
in the main upon our agreeing to believe that a pendulum swings in<span id = line_2250> [2250] </span>
<br>
a perfectly uniform manner, each vibration taking the same time as<span id = line_2251> [2251] </span>
<br>
the next one. Of course we cannot prove that this is true, it is,<span id = line_2252> [2252] </span>
<br>
strictly speaking, a definition of what we mean by equal intervals<span id = line_2253> [2253] </span>
<br>
of time; and it is not a particularly good definition at that. Its<span id = line_2254> [2254] </span>
<br>
limitations are sufficiently obvious. The best way to proceed is<span id = line_2255> [2255] </span>
<br>
to consider the concept of uniform velocity, and then, using the<span id = line_2256> [2256] </span>
<br>
idea of some entity having such a uniform velocity, to define equal<span id = line_2257> [2257] </span>
<br>
intervals of time as such intervals as are required for the entity<span id = line_2258> [2258] </span>
<br>
to traverse equal lengths. These last we have already defined. What<span id = line_2259> [2259] </span>
<br>
is required in addition is to adopt some moving entity as giving our<span id = line_2260> [2260] </span>
<br>
definition of uniform velocity. Considering our known universe it<span id = line_2261> [2261] </span>
<br>
is self-evident that we should choose in our definition of uniform<span id = line_2262> [2262] </span>
<br>
velocity the velocity of light, since this selection could be made by<span id = line_2263> [2263] </span>
<br>
an observer anywhere in our universe. Having agreed then to illustrate<span id = line_2264> [2264] </span>
<br>
by the words "uniform velocity" that of light, our definition of equal<span id = line_2265> [2265] </span>
<br>
intervals of time is complete. This implies, of course, that there is<span id = line_2266> [2266] </span>
<br>
no uncertainty on our part as to the fact that the velocity of light<span id = line_2267> [2267] </span>
<br>
always has the same value at any one point in the universe to any<span id = line_2268> [2268] </span>
<br>
observer, quite regardless of the source of light. In other words,<span id = line_2269> [2269] </span>
<br>
the postulate that this is true underlies our definition. Following<span id = line_2270> [2270] </span>
<br>
this method Einstein developed a system of measuring both space and<span id = line_2271> [2271] </span>
<br>
time intervals. As a matter of fact his system is identically that<span id = line_2272> [2272] </span>
<br>
which we use in daily life with reference to events here on the<span id = line_2273> [2273] </span>
<br>
earth. He further showed that if a man were to measure the length<span id = line_2274> [2274] </span>
<br>
of a rod, for instance, on the earth and then were able to carry the<span id = line_2275> [2275] </span>
<br>
rod and his measuring apparatus to Mars, the sun, or to Arcturus he<span id = line_2276> [2276] </span>
<br>
would obtain the same numerical value for the length in all places<span id = line_2277> [2277] </span>
<br>
and at all times. This doesn't mean that any statement is implied<span id = line_2278> [2278] </span>
<br>
as to whether the length of the rod has remained unchanged or not;<span id = line_2279> [2279] </span>
<br>
such words do not have any meaning--remember that we can not speak of<span id = line_2280> [2280] </span>
<br>
true length. It is thus clear that an observer living on the earth<span id = line_2281> [2281] </span>
<br>
would have a definite system of units in terms of which to express<span id = line_2282> [2282] </span>
<br>
space and time intervals, i.e., he would have a definite system<span id = line_2283> [2283] </span>
<br>
of space coordinates (x, y, z) and a definite time coordinate (t);<span id = line_2284> [2284] </span>
<br>
and similarly an observer living on Mars would have his system of<span id = line_2285> [2285] </span>
<br>
coordinates (x', y', z', t'). Provided that one observer has a definite<span id = line_2286> [2286] </span>
<br>
uniform velocity with reference to the other, it is a comparatively<span id = line_2287> [2287] </span>
<br>
simple matter to deduce the mathematical relations between the two<span id = line_2288> [2288] </span>
<br>
sets of coordinates. When Einstein did this, he arrived at the same<span id = line_2289> [2289] </span>
<br>
transformation formulæ as those used by Lorentz in his development of<span id = line_2290> [2290] </span>
<br>
Maxwell's equations. The latter had shown that, using these formulæ,<span id = line_2291> [2291] </span>
<br>
the form of the laws for all electromagnetic phenomena maintained<span id = line_2292> [2292] </span>
<br>
the same form; so Einstein's method proves that using his system of<span id = line_2293> [2293] </span>
<br>
measurement an observer, anywhere in the universe, would as the result<span id = line_2294> [2294] </span>
<br>
of his own investigation of electromagnetic phenomena arrive at the<span id = line_2295> [2295] </span>
<br>
same mathematical statement of them as any other observer, provided<span id = line_2296> [2296] </span>
<br>
only that the relative-velocity of the two observers was uniform.<span id = line_2297> [2297] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2298> [2298] </span>
<br>
Einstein discussed many other most important questions at this time;<span id = line_2299> [2299] </span>
<br>
but it is not necessary to refer to them in connection with the<span id = line_2300> [2300] </span>
<br>
present subject. So far as this is concerned, the next important<span id = line_2301> [2301] </span>
<br>
step to note is that taken in the famous address of Minkowski, in<span id = line_2302> [2302] </span>
<br>
1908, on the subject of "Space and Time." It would be difficult to<span id = line_2303> [2303] </span>
<br>
overstate the importance of the concepts advanced by Minkowski. They<span id = line_2304> [2304] </span>
<br>
marked the beginning of a new period in the philosophy of physics. I<span id = line_2305> [2305] </span>
<br>
shall not attempt to explain his ideas in detail, but shall confine<span id = line_2306> [2306] </span>
<br>
myself to a few general statements. His point of view and his line of<span id = line_2307> [2307] </span>
<br>
development of the theme are absolutely different from those of Lorentz<span id = line_2308> [2308] </span>
<br>
or of Einstein; but in the end he makes use of the same transformation<span id = line_2309> [2309] </span>
<br>
formulæ. His great contribution consists in giving us a new geometrical<span id = line_2310> [2310] </span>
<br>
picture of their meaning. It is scarcely fair to call Minkowski's<span id = line_2311> [2311] </span>
<br>
development a picture; for to us a picture can never have more than<span id = line_2312> [2312] </span>
<br>
three dimensions, our senses limit us; while his picture calls for<span id = line_2313> [2313] </span>
<br>
perception of four dimensions. It is this fact that renders any even<span id = line_2314> [2314] </span>
<br>
semi-popular discussion of Minkowski's work so impossible. We can all<span id = line_2315> [2315] </span>
<br>
see that for us to describe any event a knowledge of four coordinates<span id = line_2316> [2316] </span>
<br>
is necessary, three for the space specification and one for the time. A<span id = line_2317> [2317] </span>
<br>
complete picture could be given then by a point in four dimensions. All<span id = line_2318> [2318] </span>
<br>
four coordinates are necessary: we never observe an event except at<span id = line_2319> [2319] </span>
<br>
a certain time, and we never observe an instant of time except with<span id = line_2320> [2320] </span>
<br>
reference to space. Discussing the laws of electromagnetic phenomena,<span id = line_2321> [2321] </span>
<br>
Minkowski showed how in a space of four dimensions, by a suitable<span id = line_2322> [2322] </span>
<br>
definition of axes, the mathematical transformation of Lorentz and<span id = line_2323> [2323] </span>
<br>
Einstein could be described by a rotation of the set of axes. We are<span id = line_2324> [2324] </span>
<br>
all accustomed to a rotation of our ordinary cartesian set of axes<span id = line_2325> [2325] </span>
<br>
describing the position of a point. We ordinarily choose our axes at<span id = line_2326> [2326] </span>
<br>
any location on the earth as follows: one vertical, one east and west,<span id = line_2327> [2327] </span>
<br>
one north and south. So if we move from any one laboratory to another,<span id = line_2328> [2328] </span>
<br>
we change our axes; they are always orthogonal, but in moving from<span id = line_2329> [2329] </span>
<br>
place to place there is a rotation. Similarly, Minkowski showed that<span id = line_2330> [2330] </span>
<br>
if we choose four orthogonal axes at any point on the earth, according<span id = line_2331> [2331] </span>
<br>
to his method, to represent a space-time point using the method of<span id = line_2332> [2332] </span>
<br>
measuring space and time intervals as outlined by Einstein; and, if<span id = line_2333> [2333] </span>
<br>
an observer on Arcturus used a similar set of axes and the method of<span id = line_2334> [2334] </span>
<br>
measurement which he naturally would, the set of axes of the latter<span id = line_2335> [2335] </span>
<br>
could be obtained from those of the observer on the earth by a pure<span id = line_2336> [2336] </span>
<br>
rotation (and naturally a transfer of the origin). This is a beautiful<span id = line_2337> [2337] </span>
<br>
geometrical result. To complete my statement of the method, I must<span id = line_2338> [2338] </span>
<br>
add that instead of using as his fourth axis one along which numerical<span id = line_2339> [2339] </span>
<br>
values of time are laid off, Minkowski defined his fourth coordinate<span id = line_2340> [2340] </span>
<br>
as the product of time and the imaginary constant, the square root of<span id = line_2341> [2341] </span>
<br>
minus one. This introduction of imaginary quantities might be expected,<span id = line_2342> [2342] </span>
<br>
possibly, to introduce difficulties; but, in reality, it is the very<span id = line_2343> [2343] </span>
<br>
essence of the simplicity of the geometrical description just given<span id = line_2344> [2344] </span>
<br>
of the rotation of the sets of axes. It thus appears that different<span id = line_2345> [2345] </span>
<br>
observers situated at different points in the universe would each have<span id = line_2346> [2346] </span>
<br>
their own set of axes, all different, yet all connected by the fact<span id = line_2347> [2347] </span>
<br>
that any one can be rotated so as to coincide with any other. This<span id = line_2348> [2348] </span>
<br>
means that there is no one direction in the four-dimensional space<span id = line_2349> [2349] </span>
<br>
that corresponds to time for all observers. Just as with reference to<span id = line_2350> [2350] </span>
<br>
the earth there is no direction which can be called vertical for all<span id = line_2351> [2351] </span>
<br>
observers living on the earth. In the sense of an absolute meaning<span id = line_2352> [2352] </span>
<br>
the words "up and down," "before and after," "sooner or later,"<span id = line_2353> [2353] </span>
<br>
are entirely meaningless.<span id = line_2354> [2354] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2355> [2355] </span>
<br>
This concept of Minkowski's may be made clearer, perhaps, by the<span id = line_2356> [2356] </span>
<br>
following process of thought. If we take a section through our<span id = line_2357> [2357] </span>
<br>
three-dimensional space, we have a plane, i.e., a two-dimensional<span id = line_2358> [2358] </span>
<br>
space. Similarly, if a section is made through a four-dimensional<span id = line_2359> [2359] </span>
<br>
space, one of three dimensions is obtained. Thus, for an observer on<span id = line_2360> [2360] </span>
<br>
the earth a definite section of Minkowski's four-dimensional space will<span id = line_2361> [2361] </span>
<br>
give us our ordinary three-dimensional one; so that this section will,<span id = line_2362> [2362] </span>
<br>
as it were, break up Minkowski's space into our space and give us our<span id = line_2363> [2363] </span>
<br>
ordinary time. Similarly, a different section would have to be used<span id = line_2364> [2364] </span>
<br>
to the observer on Arcturus; but by a suitable selection he would<span id = line_2365> [2365] </span>
<br>
get his own familiar three-dimensional space and his own time. Thus<span id = line_2366> [2366] </span>
<br>
the space defined by Minkowski is completely isotropic in reference<span id = line_2367> [2367] </span>
<br>
to measured lengths and times, there is absolutely no difference<span id = line_2368> [2368] </span>
<br>
between any two directions in an absolute sense; for any particular<span id = line_2369> [2369] </span>
<br>
observer, of course, a particular section will cause the space to<span id = line_2370> [2370] </span>
<br>
fall apart so as to suit his habits of measurement; any section,<span id = line_2371> [2371] </span>
<br>
however, taken at random will do the same thing for some observer<span id = line_2372> [2372] </span>
<br>
somewhere. From another point of view, that of Lorentz and Einstein,<span id = line_2373> [2373] </span>
<br>
it is obvious that, since this four-dimensional space is isotropic,<span id = line_2374> [2374] </span>
<br>
the expression of the laws of electromagnetic phenomena take identical<span id = line_2375> [2375] </span>
<br>
mathematical forms when expressed by any observer.<span id = line_2376> [2376] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2377> [2377] </span>
<br>
The question of course must be raised as to what can be said in regard<span id = line_2378> [2378] </span>
<br>
to phenomena which so far as we know do not have an electromagnetic<span id = line_2379> [2379] </span>
<br>
origin. In particular what can be done with respect to gravitational<span id = line_2380> [2380] </span>
<br>
phenomena? Before, however, showing how this problem was attacked by<span id = line_2381> [2381] </span>
<br>
Einstein; and the fact that the subject of my address is Einstein's<span id = line_2382> [2382] </span>
<br>
work on gravitation shows that ultimately I shall explain this, I<span id = line_2383> [2383] </span>
<br>
must emphasize another feature of Minkowski's geometry. To describe<span id = line_2384> [2384] </span>
<br>
the space-time characteristics of any event a point, defined by its<span id = line_2385> [2385] </span>
<br>
four coordinates, is sufficient; so, if one observes the life-history<span id = line_2386> [2386] </span>
<br>
of any entity, e.g., a particle of matter, a light-wave, etc., he<span id = line_2387> [2387] </span>
<br>
observes a sequence of points in the space-time continuum; that is,<span id = line_2388> [2388] </span>
<br>
the life-history of any entity is described fully by a line in this<span id = line_2389> [2389] </span>
<br>
space. Such a line was called by Minkowski a "world-line." Further,<span id = line_2390> [2390] </span>
<br>
from a different point of view, all of our observations of nature<span id = line_2391> [2391] </span>
<br>
are in reality observations of coincidences, e.g., if one reads<span id = line_2392> [2392] </span>
<br>
a thermometer, what he does is to note the coincidence of the<span id = line_2393> [2393] </span>
<br>
end of the column of mercury with a certain scale division on<span id = line_2394> [2394] </span>
<br>
the thermometer tube. In other words, thinking of the world-line<span id = line_2395> [2395] </span>
<br>
of the end of the mercury column and the world-line of the scale<span id = line_2396> [2396] </span>
<br>
division, what we have observed was the intersection or crossing of<span id = line_2397> [2397] </span>
<br>
these lines. In a similar manner any observation may be analyzed;<span id = line_2398> [2398] </span>
<br>
and remembering that light rays, a point on the retina of the eye,<span id = line_2399> [2399] </span>
<br>
etc., all have their world-lines, it will be recognized that it is<span id = line_2400> [2400] </span>
<br>
a perfectly accurate statement to say that every observation is the<span id = line_2401> [2401] </span>
<br>
perception of the intersection of world-lines. Further, since all we<span id = line_2402> [2402] </span>
<br>
know of a world-line is the result of observations, it is evident<span id = line_2403> [2403] </span>
<br>
that we do not know a world-line as a continuous series of points,<span id = line_2404> [2404] </span>
<br>
but simply as a series of discontinuous points, each point being where<span id = line_2405> [2405] </span>
<br>
the particular world-line in question is crossed by another world-line.<span id = line_2406> [2406] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2407> [2407] </span>
<br>
It is clear, moreover, that for the description of a world-line<span id = line_2408> [2408] </span>
<br>
we are not limited to the particular set of four orthogonal axes<span id = line_2409> [2409] </span>
<br>
adopted by Minkowski. We can choose any set of four-dimensional<span id = line_2410> [2410] </span>
<br>
axes we wish. It is further evident that the mathematical expression<span id = line_2411> [2411] </span>
<br>
for the coincidence of two points is absolutely independent of our<span id = line_2412> [2412] </span>
<br>
selection of reference axes. If we change our axes, we will change<span id = line_2413> [2413] </span>
<br>
the coordinates of both points simultaneously, so that the question<span id = line_2414> [2414] </span>
<br>
of axes ceases to be of interest. But our so-called laws of nature are<span id = line_2415> [2415] </span>
<br>
nothing but descriptions in mathematical language of our observations;<span id = line_2416> [2416] </span>
<br>
we observe only coincidences; a sequence of coincidences when put in<span id = line_2417> [2417] </span>
<br>
mathematical terms takes a form which is independent of the selection<span id = line_2418> [2418] </span>
<br>
of reference axes; therefore the mathematical expression of our laws<span id = line_2419> [2419] </span>
<br>
of nature, of every character, must be such that their form does<span id = line_2420> [2420] </span>
<br>
not change if we make a transformation of axes. This is a simple but<span id = line_2421> [2421] </span>
<br>
far-reaching deduction.<span id = line_2422> [2422] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2423> [2423] </span>
<br>
There is a geometrical method of picturing the effect of a change<span id = line_2424> [2424] </span>
<br>
of axes of reference, i.e., of a mathematical transformation. To a<span id = line_2425> [2425] </span>
<br>
man in a railway coach the path of a drop of water does not appear<span id = line_2426> [2426] </span>
<br>
vertical, i.e., it is not parallel to the edge of the window; still<span id = line_2427> [2427] </span>
<br>
less so does it appear vertical to a man performing manoeuvres in<span id = line_2428> [2428] </span>
<br>
an airplane. This means that whereas with reference to axes fixed<span id = line_2429> [2429] </span>
<br>
to the earth the path of the drop is vertical; with reference to<span id = line_2430> [2430] </span>
<br>
other axes, the path is not. Or, stating the conclusion in general<span id = line_2431> [2431] </span>
<br>
language, changing the axes of reference (or effecting a mathematical<span id = line_2432> [2432] </span>
<br>
transformation) in general changes the shape of any line. If one<span id = line_2433> [2433] </span>
<br>
imagines the line forming a part of the space, it is evident that<span id = line_2434> [2434] </span>
<br>
if the space is deformed by compression or expansion the shape of<span id = line_2435> [2435] </span>
<br>
the line is changed, and if sufficient care is taken it is clearly<span id = line_2436> [2436] </span>
<br>
possible, by deforming the space, to make the line take any shape<span id = line_2437> [2437] </span>
<br>
desired, or better stated, any shape specified by the previous change<span id = line_2438> [2438] </span>
<br>
of axes. It is thus possible to picture a mathematical transformation<span id = line_2439> [2439] </span>
<br>
as a deformation of space. Thus I can draw a line on a sheet of paper<span id = line_2440> [2440] </span>
<br>
or of rubber and by bending and stretching the sheet, I can make the<span id = line_2441> [2441] </span>
<br>
line assume a great variety of shapes; each of these new shapes is<span id = line_2442> [2442] </span>
<br>
a picture of a suitable transformation.<span id = line_2443> [2443] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2444> [2444] </span>
<br>
Now, consider world-lines in our four-dimensional space. The<span id = line_2445> [2445] </span>
<br>
complete record of all our knowledge is a series of sequences of<span id = line_2446> [2446] </span>
<br>
intersections of such lines. By analogy I can draw in ordinary space<span id = line_2447> [2447] </span>
<br>
a great number of intersecting lines on a sheet of rubber; I can<span id = line_2448> [2448] </span>
<br>
then bend and deform the sheet to please myself; by so doing I do<span id = line_2449> [2449] </span>
<br>
not introduce any new intersections nor do I alter in the least the<span id = line_2450> [2450] </span>
<br>
sequence of intersections. So in the space of our world-lines, the<span id = line_2451> [2451] </span>
<br>
space may be deformed in any imaginable manner without introducing<span id = line_2452> [2452] </span>
<br>
any new intersections or changing the sequence of the existing<span id = line_2453> [2453] </span>
<br>
intersections. It is this sequence which gives us the mathematical<span id = line_2454> [2454] </span>
<br>
expression of our so-called experimental laws; a deformation of<span id = line_2455> [2455] </span>
<br>
our space is equivalent mathematically to a transformation of axes,<span id = line_2456> [2456] </span>
<br>
consequently we see why it is that the form of our laws must be the<span id = line_2457> [2457] </span>
<br>
same when referred to any and all sets of axes, that is, must remain<span id = line_2458> [2458] </span>
<br>
unaltered by any mathematical transformation.<span id = line_2459> [2459] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2460> [2460] </span>
<br>
Now, at last we come to gravitation. We can not imagine any world-line<span id = line_2461> [2461] </span>
<br>
simpler than that of a particle of matter left to itself; we shall<span id = line_2462> [2462] </span>
<br>
therefore call it a "straight" line. Our experience is that two<span id = line_2463> [2463] </span>
<br>
particles of matter attract one another. Expressed in terms of<span id = line_2464> [2464] </span>
<br>
world-lines, this means that, if the world-lines of two isolated<span id = line_2465> [2465] </span>
<br>
particles come near each other, the lines, instead of being straight,<span id = line_2466> [2466] </span>
<br>
will be deflected or bent in towards each other. The world-line of<span id = line_2467> [2467] </span>
<br>
any one particle is therefore deformed; and we have just seen that a<span id = line_2468> [2468] </span>
<br>
deformation is the equivalent of a mathematical transformation. In<span id = line_2469> [2469] </span>
<br>
other words, for any one particle it is possible to replace the<span id = line_2470> [2470] </span>
<br>
effect of a gravitational field at any instant by a mathematical<span id = line_2471> [2471] </span>
<br>
transformation of axes. The statement that this is always possible<span id = line_2472> [2472] </span>
<br>
for any particle at any instant is Einstein's famous "Principle<span id = line_2473> [2473] </span>
<br>
of Equivalence."<span id = line_2474> [2474] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2475> [2475] </span>
<br>
Let us rest for a moment, while I call attention to a most interesting<span id = line_2476> [2476] </span>
<br>
coincidence, not to be thought of as an intersection of world-lines. It<span id = line_2477> [2477] </span>
<br>
is said that Newton's thoughts were directed to the observation of<span id = line_2478> [2478] </span>
<br>
gravitational phenomena by an apple falling on his head; from this<span id = line_2479> [2479] </span>
<br>
striking event he passed by natural steps to a consideration of the<span id = line_2480> [2480] </span>
<br>
universality of gravitation. Einstein in describing his mental process<span id = line_2481> [2481] </span>
<br>
in the evolution of his law of gravitation says that his attention<span id = line_2482> [2482] </span>
<br>
was called to a new point of view by discussing his experiences with<span id = line_2483> [2483] </span>
<br>
a man whose fall from a high building he had just witnessed. The man<span id = line_2484> [2484] </span>
<br>
fortunately suffered no serious injuries and assured Einstein that in<span id = line_2485> [2485] </span>
<br>
the course of his fall he had not been conscious in the least of any<span id = line_2486> [2486] </span>
<br>
pull downward on his body. In mathematical language, with reference to<span id = line_2487> [2487] </span>
<br>
axes moving with the man the force of gravity had disappeared. This is<span id = line_2488> [2488] </span>
<br>
a case where by the transfer of the axes from the earth itself to the<span id = line_2489> [2489] </span>
<br>
man, the force of the gravitational field is annulled. The converse<span id = line_2490> [2490] </span>
<br>
change of axes from the falling man to a point on the earth could be<span id = line_2491> [2491] </span>
<br>
considered as introducing the force of gravity into the equations of<span id = line_2492> [2492] </span>
<br>
motion. Another illustration of the introduction into our equations of<span id = line_2493> [2493] </span>
<br>
a force by a means of a change of axes is furnished by the ordinary<span id = line_2494> [2494] </span>
<br>
treatment of a body in uniform rotation about an axis. For instance,<span id = line_2495> [2495] </span>
<br>
in the case of a so-called conical pendulum, that is, the motion of a<span id = line_2496> [2496] </span>
<br>
bob suspended from a fixed point by string, which is so set in motion<span id = line_2497> [2497] </span>
<br>
that the bob describes a horizontal circle and the string therefore<span id = line_2498> [2498] </span>
<br>
describes a circular cone, if we transfer our axes from the earth and<span id = line_2499> [2499] </span>
<br>
have them rotate around the vertical line through the fixed point with<span id = line_2500> [2500] </span>
<br>
the same angular velocity as the bob, it is necessary to introduce into<span id = line_2501> [2501] </span>
<br>
our equations of motion a fictitious "force" called the centrifugal<span id = line_2502> [2502] </span>
<br>
force. No one ever thinks of this force other than as a mathematical<span id = line_2503> [2503] </span>
<br>
quantity introduced into the equations for the sake of simplicity of<span id = line_2504> [2504] </span>
<br>
treatment; no physical meaning is attached to it. Why should there<span id = line_2505> [2505] </span>
<br>
be to any other so-called "force," which like centrifugal force,<span id = line_2506> [2506] </span>
<br>
is independent of the nature of the matter? Again, here on the earth<span id = line_2507> [2507] </span>
<br>
our sensation of weight is interpreted mathematically by combining<span id = line_2508> [2508] </span>
<br>
expressions for centrifugal force and gravity; we have no distinct<span id = line_2509> [2509] </span>
<br>
sensation for either separately. Why then is there any difference in<span id = line_2510> [2510] </span>
<br>
the essence of the two? Why not consider them both as brought into<span id = line_2511> [2511] </span>
<br>
our equations by the agency of mathematical transformations? This is<span id = line_2512> [2512] </span>
<br>
Einstein's point of view.<span id = line_2513> [2513] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2514> [2514] </span>
<br>
Granting, then, the principle of equivalence, we can so choose axes at<span id = line_2515> [2515] </span>
<br>
any point at any instant that the gravitational field will disappear;<span id = line_2516> [2516] </span>
<br>
these axes are therefore of what Eddington calls the "Galilean"<span id = line_2517> [2517] </span>
<br>
type, the simplest possible. Consider, that is, an observer in a<span id = line_2518> [2518] </span>
<br>
box, or compartment, which is falling with the acceleration of the<span id = line_2519> [2519] </span>
<br>
gravitational field at that point. He would not be conscious of the<span id = line_2520> [2520] </span>
<br>
field. If there were a projectile fired off in this compartment,<span id = line_2521> [2521] </span>
<br>
the observer would describe its path as being straight. In this space<span id = line_2522> [2522] </span>
<br>
the infinitesimal interval between two space-time points would then<span id = line_2523> [2523] </span>
<br>
be given by the formula<span id = line_2524> [2524] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2525> [2525] </span>
<br>
    $$ds^2 = dx^2_1 + dx2_2 + dx^2_3 + dx2_4,$$<span id = line_2526> [2526] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2527> [2527] </span>
<br>
where ds is the interval and $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ are coordinates. If<span id = line_2528> [2528] </span>
<br>
we make a mathematical transformation, i.e., use another set of axes,<span id = line_2529> [2529] </span>
<br>
this interval would obviously take the form<span id = line_2530> [2530] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2531> [2531] </span>
<br>
    $$ds^2 = g_{11}dx^2_{33} + g_{22}dx^2_2 + g_{33}dx^2_3 +<span id = line_2532> [2532] </span>
<br>
      g_{44}dx2_4 + 2g_{12}dx_1dx_2 + \rm{etc.},$$<span id = line_2533> [2533] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2534> [2534] </span>
<br>
where $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and $x_4$ are now coordinates referring to the<span id = line_2535> [2535] </span>
<br>
new axes. This relation involves ten coefficients, the coefficients<span id = line_2536> [2536] </span>
<br>
defining the transformation.<span id = line_2537> [2537] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2538> [2538] </span>
<br>
But of course a certain dynamical value is also attached to the<span id = line_2539> [2539] </span>
<br>
g's, because by the transfer of our axes from the Galilean type<span id = line_2540> [2540] </span>
<br>
we have made a change which is equivalent to the introduction of<span id = line_2541> [2541] </span>
<br>
a gravitational field; and the g's must specify the field. That<span id = line_2542> [2542] </span>
<br>
is, these g's are the expressions of our experiences, and hence<span id = line_2543> [2543] </span>
<br>
their values can not depend upon the use of any special axes; the<span id = line_2544> [2544] </span>
<br>
values must be the same for all selections. In other words, whatever<span id = line_2545> [2545] </span>
<br>
function of the coordinates any one g is for one set of axes, if other<span id = line_2546> [2546] </span>
<br>
axes are chosen, this g must still be the same function of the new<span id = line_2547> [2547] </span>
<br>
coordinates. There are ten g's defined by differential equations;<span id = line_2548> [2548] </span>
<br>
so we have ten covariant equations. Einstein showed how these g's<span id = line_2549> [2549] </span>
<br>
could be regarded as generalized potentials of the field. Our own<span id = line_2550> [2550] </span>
<br>
experiments and observations upon gravitation have given us a certain<span id = line_2551> [2551] </span>
<br>
knowledge concerning its potential; that is, we know a value for it<span id = line_2552> [2552] </span>
<br>
which must be so near the truth that we can properly call it at least<span id = line_2553> [2553] </span>
<br>
a first approximation. Or, stated differently, if Einstein succeeds in<span id = line_2554> [2554] </span>
<br>
deducing the rigid value for the gravitational potential in any field,<span id = line_2555> [2555] </span>
<br>
it must degenerate to the Newtonian value for the great majority of<span id = line_2556> [2556] </span>
<br>
cases with which we have actual experience. Einstein's method, then,<span id = line_2557> [2557] </span>
<br>
was to investigate the functions (or equations) which would satisfy<span id = line_2558> [2558] </span>
<br>
the mathematical conditions just described. A transformation from<span id = line_2559> [2559] </span>
<br>
the axes used by the observer in the following box may be made so as<span id = line_2560> [2560] </span>
<br>
to introduce into the equations the gravitational field recognized<span id = line_2561> [2561] </span>
<br>
by an observer on the earth near the box; but this, obviously, would<span id = line_2562> [2562] </span>
<br>
not be the general gravitational field, because the field changes as<span id = line_2563> [2563] </span>
<br>
one moves over the surface of the earth. A solution found, therefore,<span id = line_2564> [2564] </span>
<br>
as just indicated, would not be the one sought for the general field;<span id = line_2565> [2565] </span>
<br>
and another must be found which is less stringent than the former<span id = line_2566> [2566] </span>
<br>
but reduces to it as a special case. He found himself at liberty to<span id = line_2567> [2567] </span>
<br>
make a selection from among several possibilities, and for several<span id = line_2568> [2568] </span>
<br>
reasons chose the simplest solution. He then tested this decision<span id = line_2569> [2569] </span>
<br>
by seeing if his formulæ would degenerate to Newton's law for the<span id = line_2570> [2570] </span>
<br>
limiting case of velocities small when compared with that of light,<span id = line_2571> [2571] </span>
<br>
because this condition is satisfied in those cases to which Newton's<span id = line_2572> [2572] </span>
<br>
law applies. His formulæ satisfied this test, and he therefore was<span id = line_2573> [2573] </span>
<br>
able to announce a "law of gravitation," of which Newton's was a<span id = line_2574> [2574] </span>
<br>
special form for a simple case.<span id = line_2575> [2575] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2576> [2576] </span>
<br>
To the ordinary scholar the difficulties surmounted by Einstein in<span id = line_2577> [2577] </span>
<br>
his investigations appear stupendous. It is not improbable that the<span id = line_2578> [2578] </span>
<br>
statement which he is alleged to have made to his editor, that only<span id = line_2579> [2579] </span>
<br>
ten men in the world could understand his treatment of the subject,<span id = line_2580> [2580] </span>
<br>
is true. I am fully prepared to believe it, and wish to add that I<span id = line_2581> [2581] </span>
<br>
certainly am not one of the ten. But I can also say that, after a<span id = line_2582> [2582] </span>
<br>
careful and serious study of his papers, I feel confident that there<span id = line_2583> [2583] </span>
<br>
is nothing in them which I can not understand, given the time to become<span id = line_2584> [2584] </span>
<br>
familiar with the special mathematical processes used. The more I work<span id = line_2585> [2585] </span>
<br>
over Einstein's papers, the more impressed I am, not simply by his<span id = line_2586> [2586] </span>
<br>
genius in viewing the problem, but also by his great technical skill.<span id = line_2587> [2587] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2588> [2588] </span>
<br>
Following the path outlined, Einstein, as just said, arrived at certain<span id = line_2589> [2589] </span>
<br>
mathematical laws for a gravitational field, laws which reduced<span id = line_2590> [2590] </span>
<br>
to Newton's form in most cases where observations are possible,<span id = line_2591> [2591] </span>
<br>
but which led to different conclusions in a few cases, knowledge<span id = line_2592> [2592] </span>
<br>
concerning which we might obtain by careful observations. I shall<span id = line_2593> [2593] </span>
<br>
mention a few deductions from Einstein's formulæ.<span id = line_2594> [2594] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2595> [2595] </span>
<br>
1. If a heavy particle is put at the center of a circle, and, if<span id = line_2596> [2596] </span>
<br>
the length of the circumference and the length of the diameter<span id = line_2597> [2597] </span>
<br>
are measured, it will be found that their ratio is not [pi]<span id = line_2598> [2598] </span>
<br>
(3.14159). In other words the geometrical properties of space in such<span id = line_2599> [2599] </span>
<br>
a gravitational field are not those discussed by Euclid; the space is,<span id = line_2600> [2600] </span>
<br>
then, non-Euclidean. There is no way by which this deduction can be<span id = line_2601> [2601] </span>
<br>
verified, the difference between the predicted ratio and [pi] is<span id = line_2602> [2602] </span>
<br>
too minute for us to hope to make our measurements with sufficient<span id = line_2603> [2603] </span>
<br>
exactness to determine the difference.<span id = line_2604> [2604] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2605> [2605] </span>
<br>
2. All the lines in the solar spectrum should with reference to lines<span id = line_2606> [2606] </span>
<br>
obtained by terrestrial sources be displaced slightly towards longer<span id = line_2607> [2607] </span>
<br>
wave-lengths. The amount of displacement predicted for lines in the<span id = line_2608> [2608] </span>
<br>
blue end of the spectrum is about one-hundredth of an Angstrom unit,<span id = line_2609> [2609] </span>
<br>
a quantity well within experimental limits. Unfortunately, as far<span id = line_2610> [2610] </span>
<br>
as the testing of this prediction is concerned, there are several<span id = line_2611> [2611] </span>
<br>
physical causes which are also operating to cause displacement of the<span id = line_2612> [2612] </span>
<br>
spectrum-lines; and so at present a decision can not be rendered as<span id = line_2613> [2613] </span>
<br>
to the verification. St. John and other workers at the Mount Wilson<span id = line_2614> [2614] </span>
<br>
Observatory have the question under investigation.<span id = line_2615> [2615] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2616> [2616] </span>
<br>
3. According to Newton's law an isolated planet in its motion around a<span id = line_2617> [2617] </span>
<br>
central sun would describe, period after period, the same elliptical<span id = line_2618> [2618] </span>
<br>
orbit; whereas Einstein's laws lead to the prediction that the<span id = line_2619> [2619] </span>
<br>
successive orbits traversed would not be identically the same. Each<span id = line_2620> [2620] </span>
<br>
revolution would start the planet off on an orbit very approximately<span id = line_2621> [2621] </span>
<br>
elliptical, but with the major axis of the ellipse rotated slightly in<span id = line_2622> [2622] </span>
<br>
the plane of the orbit. When calculations were made for the various<span id = line_2623> [2623] </span>
<br>
planets in our solar system, it was found that the only one which<span id = line_2624> [2624] </span>
<br>
was of interest from the standpoint of verification of Einstein's<span id = line_2625> [2625] </span>
<br>
formulæ was Mercury. It has been known for a long time that there<span id = line_2626> [2626] </span>
<br>
was actually such a change as just described in the orbit of Mercury,<span id = line_2627> [2627] </span>
<br>
amounting to 574'' of arc per century; and it has been shown that of<span id = line_2628> [2628] </span>
<br>
this a rotation of 532'' was due to the direct action of other planets,<span id = line_2629> [2629] </span>
<br>
thus leaving an unexplained rotation of 42'' per century. Einstein's<span id = line_2630> [2630] </span>
<br>
formulæ predicted a rotation of 43'', a striking agreement.<span id = line_2631> [2631] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2632> [2632] </span>
<br>
4. In accordance with Einstein's formulæ a ray of light passing close<span id = line_2633> [2633] </span>
<br>
to a heavy piece of matter, the sun, for instance, should experience<span id = line_2634> [2634] </span>
<br>
a sensible deflection in towards the sun. This might be expected from<span id = line_2635> [2635] </span>
<br>
"general" consideration of energy in motion; energy and mass are<span id = line_2636> [2636] </span>
<br>
generally considered to be identical in the sense that an amount<span id = line_2637> [2637] </span>
<br>
of energy E has the mass $E1c^2$ where c is the velocity of light;<span id = line_2638> [2638] </span>
<br>
and consequently a ray of light might fall within the province of<span id = line_2639> [2639] </span>
<br>
gravitation and the amount of deflection to be expected could be<span id = line_2640> [2640] </span>
<br>
calculated by the ordinary formula for gravitation. Another point<span id = line_2641> [2641] </span>
<br>
of view is to consider again the observer inside the compartment<span id = line_2642> [2642] </span>
<br>
falling with the acceleration of the gravitational field. To him the<span id = line_2643> [2643] </span>
<br>
path of a projectile and a ray of light would both appear straight;<span id = line_2644> [2644] </span>
<br>
so that, if the projectile had a velocity equal to that of light, it<span id = line_2645> [2645] </span>
<br>
and the light wave would travel side by side. To an observer outside<span id = line_2646> [2646] </span>
<br>
the compartment, e.g., to one on the earth, both would then appear<span id = line_2647> [2647] </span>
<br>
to have the same deflection owing to the sun. But how much would<span id = line_2648> [2648] </span>
<br>
the path of the projectile be bent? What would be the shape of its<span id = line_2649> [2649] </span>
<br>
parabola? One might apply Newton's law; but, according to Einstein's<span id = line_2650> [2650] </span>
<br>
formulæ, Newton's law should be used only for small velocities. In the<span id = line_2651> [2651] </span>
<br>
case of a ray passing close to the sun it was decided that according<span id = line_2652> [2652] </span>
<br>
to Einstein's formula there should be a deflection of 1''.75 whereas<span id = line_2653> [2653] </span>
<br>
Newton's law of gravitation predicted half this amount. Careful<span id = line_2654> [2654] </span>
<br>
plans were made by various astronomers, to investigate this question<span id = line_2655> [2655] </span>
<br>
at the solar eclipse last May, and the result announced by Dyson,<span id = line_2656> [2656] </span>
<br>
Eddington and Crommelin, the leaders of astronomy in England, was<span id = line_2657> [2657] </span>
<br>
that there was a deflection of 1''.9. Of course the detection of such<span id = line_2658> [2658] </span>
<br>
a minute deflection was an extraordinarily difficult matter, so many<span id = line_2659> [2659] </span>
<br>
corrections had to be applied to the original observations; but the<span id = line_2660> [2660] </span>
<br>
names of the men who record the conclusions are such as to inspire<span id = line_2661> [2661] </span>
<br>
confidence. Certainly any effect of refraction seems to be excluded.<span id = line_2662> [2662] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2663> [2663] </span>
<br>
It is thus seen that the formulæ deduced by Einstein have been<span id = line_2664> [2664] </span>
<br>
confirmed in a variety of ways and in a most brilliant manner. In<span id = line_2665> [2665] </span>
<br>
connection with these formulæ one question must arise in the minds of<span id = line_2666> [2666] </span>
<br>
everyone; by what process, where in the course of the mathematical<span id = line_2667> [2667] </span>
<br>
development, does the idea of mass reveal itself? It was not in<span id = line_2668> [2668] </span>
<br>
the equations at the beginning and yet here it is at the end. How<span id = line_2669> [2669] </span>
<br>
does it appear? As a matter of fact it is first seen as a constant<span id = line_2670> [2670] </span>
<br>
of integration in the discussion of the problem of the gravitational<span id = line_2671> [2671] </span>
<br>
field due to a single particle; and the identity of this constant with<span id = line_2672> [2672] </span>
<br>
mass is proved when one compares Einstein's formulæ with Newton's<span id = line_2673> [2673] </span>
<br>
law which is simply its degenerated form. This mass, though, is the<span id = line_2674> [2674] </span>
<br>
mass of which we become aware through our experiences with weight;<span id = line_2675> [2675] </span>
<br>
and Einstein proceeded to prove that this quantity which entered as<span id = line_2676> [2676] </span>
<br>
a constant of integration in his ideally simple problem also obeyed<span id = line_2677> [2677] </span>
<br>
the laws of conservation of mass and conservation of momentum when<span id = line_2678> [2678] </span>
<br>
he investigated the problems of two and more particles. Therefore<span id = line_2679> [2679] </span>
<br>
Einstein deduced from his study of gravitational fields the well-known<span id = line_2680> [2680] </span>
<br>
properties of matter which form the basis of theoretical mechanics. A<span id = line_2681> [2681] </span>
<br>
further logical consequence of Einstein's development is to show that<span id = line_2682> [2682] </span>
<br>
energy has mass, a concept with which every one nowadays is familiar.<span id = line_2683> [2683] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2684> [2684] </span>
<br>
The description of Einstein's method which I have given so far is<span id = line_2685> [2685] </span>
<br>
simply the story of one success after another; and it is certainly<span id = line_2686> [2686] </span>
<br>
fair to ask if we have at last reached finality in our investigation<span id = line_2687> [2687] </span>
<br>
of nature, if we have attained to truth. Are there no outstanding<span id = line_2688> [2688] </span>
<br>
difficulties? Is there no possibility of error? Certainly, not<span id = line_2689> [2689] </span>
<br>
until all the predictions made from Einstein's formulæ have been<span id = line_2690> [2690] </span>
<br>
investigated can much be said; and further, it must be seen whether<span id = line_2691> [2691] </span>
<br>
any other lines of argument will lead to the same conclusions. But<span id = line_2692> [2692] </span>
<br>
without waiting for all this there is at least one difficulty which<span id = line_2693> [2693] </span>
<br>
is apparent at this time. We have discussed the laws of nature as<span id = line_2694> [2694] </span>
<br>
independent in their form of reference axes, a concept which appeals<span id = line_2695> [2695] </span>
<br>
strongly to our philosophy; yet it is not at all clear, at first sight,<span id = line_2696> [2696] </span>
<br>
that we can be justified in our belief. We can not imagine any way<span id = line_2697> [2697] </span>
<br>
by which we can become conscious of the translation of the earth in<span id = line_2698> [2698] </span>
<br>
space; but by means of gyroscopes we can learn a great deal about its<span id = line_2699> [2699] </span>
<br>
rotation on its axis. We could locate the positions of its two poles,<span id = line_2700> [2700] </span>
<br>
and by watching a Foucault pendulum or a gyroscope we can obtain a<span id = line_2701> [2701] </span>
<br>
number which we interpret as the angular velocity of rotation of axes<span id = line_2702> [2702] </span>
<br>
fixed in the earth; angular velocity with reference to what? Where<span id = line_2703> [2703] </span>
<br>
is the fundamental set of axes? This is a real difficulty. It can be<span id = line_2704> [2704] </span>
<br>
surmounted in several ways. Einstein himself has outlined a method<span id = line_2705> [2705] </span>
<br>
which in the end amounts to assuming the existence on the confines<span id = line_2706> [2706] </span>
<br>
of space of vast quantities of matter, a proposition which is not<span id = line_2707> [2707] </span>
<br>
attractive. deSitter has suggested a peculiar quality of the space<span id = line_2708> [2708] </span>
<br>
to which we refer our space-time coordinates. The consequences of<span id = line_2709> [2709] </span>
<br>
this are most interesting, but no decision can as yet be made as to<span id = line_2710> [2710] </span>
<br>
the justification of the hypothesis. In any case we can say that<span id = line_2711> [2711] </span>
<br>
the difficulty raised is not one that destroys the real value of<span id = line_2712> [2712] </span>
<br>
Einstein's work.<span id = line_2713> [2713] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2714> [2714] </span>
<br>
In conclusion I wish to emphasize the fact, which should be obvious,<span id = line_2715> [2715] </span>
<br>
that Einstein has not attempted any explanation of gravitation;<span id = line_2716> [2716] </span>
<br>
he has been occupied with the deduction of its laws. These laws,<span id = line_2717> [2717] </span>
<br>
together with those of electromagnetic phenomena, comprise our store<span id = line_2718> [2718] </span>
<br>
of knowledge. There is not the slightest indication of a mechanism,<span id = line_2719> [2719] </span>
<br>
meaning by that a picture in terms of our senses. In fact what we have<span id = line_2720> [2720] </span>
<br>
learned has been to realize that our desire to use such mechanisms<span id = line_2721> [2721] </span>
<br>
is futile.<span id = line_2722> [2722] </span>

The purpose of the expedition was to determine whether any displacement<span id = line_2738> [2738] </span>
<br>
is caused to a ray of light by the gravitational field of the sun,<span id = line_2739> [2739] </span>
<br>
and if so, the amount of the displacement. Einstein's theory predicted<span id = line_2740> [2740] </span>
<br>
a displacement varying inversely as the distance of the ray from<span id = line_2741> [2741] </span>
<br>
the sun's center, amounting to 1''.75 for a star seen just grazing<span id = line_2742> [2742] </span>

A study of the conditions of the 1919 eclipse showed that the sun<span id = line_2745> [2745] </span>
<br>
would be very favorably placed among a group of bright stars--in fact,<span id = line_2746> [2746] </span>
<br>
it would be in the most favorable possible position. A study of the<span id = line_2747> [2747] </span>
<br>
conditions at various points on the path of the eclipse, in which<span id = line_2748> [2748] </span>
<br>
Mr. Hinks helped us, pointed to Sobral, in Brazil, and Principe, an<span id = line_2749> [2749] </span>
<br>
island off the west coast of Africa, as the most favorable stations....<span id = line_2750> [2750] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2751> [2751] </span>
<br>
The Greenwich party, Dr. Crommelin and Mr. Davidson, reached Brazil<span id = line_2752> [2752] </span>
<br>
in ample time to prepare for the eclipse, and the usual preliminary<span id = line_2753> [2753] </span>
<br>
focusing by photographing stellar fields was carried out. The day of<span id = line_2754> [2754] </span>
<br>
the eclipse opened cloudy, but cleared later, and the observations<span id = line_2755> [2755] </span>
<br>
were carried out with almost complete success. With the astrographic<span id = line_2756> [2756] </span>
<br>
telescope Mr. Davidson secured 15 out of 18 photographs showing the<span id = line_2757> [2757] </span>
<br>
required stellar images. Totality lasted 6 minutes, and the average<span id = line_2758> [2758] </span>
<br>
exposure of the plates was 5 to 6 seconds. Dr. Crommelin with the<span id = line_2759> [2759] </span>
<br>
other lens had 7 successful plates out of 8. The unsuccessful plates<span id = line_2760> [2760] </span>
<br>
were spoiled for this purpose by the clouds, but show the remarkable<span id = line_2761> [2761] </span>
<br>
prominence very well.<span id = line_2762> [2762] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2763> [2763] </span>
<br>
When the plates were developed the astrographic images were found to<span id = line_2764> [2764] </span>
<br>
be out of focus. This is attributed to the effect of the sun's heat<span id = line_2765> [2765] </span>
<br>
on the coelostat mirror. The images were fuzzy and quite different<span id = line_2766> [2766] </span>
<br>
from those on the check-plates secured at night before and after the<span id = line_2767> [2767] </span>
<br>
eclipse. Fortunately the mirror which fed the 4-inch lens was not<span id = line_2768> [2768] </span>
<br>
affected, and the star images secured with this lens were good and<span id = line_2769> [2769] </span>
<br>
similar to those got by the night-plates. The observers stayed on in<span id = line_2770> [2770] </span>
<br>
Brazil until July to secure the field in the night sky at the altitude<span id = line_2771> [2771] </span>
<br>
of the eclipse epoch and under identical instrumental conditions.<span id = line_2772> [2772] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2773> [2773] </span>
<br>
The plates were measured at Greenwich immediately after the observers'<span id = line_2774> [2774] </span>
<br>
return. Each plate was measured twice over by Messrs. Davidson and<span id = line_2775> [2775] </span>
<br>
Furner, and I am satisfied that such faults as lie in the results<span id = line_2776> [2776] </span>
<br>
are in the plates themselves and not in the measures. The figures<span id = line_2777> [2777] </span>
<br>
obtained may be briefly summarized as follows: The astrographic plates<span id = line_2778> [2778] </span>
<br>
gave 0''.97 for the displacement at the limb when the scale-value was<span id = line_2779> [2779] </span>
<br>
determined from the plates themselves, and 1''.40 when the scale-value<span id = line_2780> [2780] </span>
<br>
was assumed from the check plates. But the much better plates gave<span id = line_2781> [2781] </span>
<br>
for the displacement at the limb 1''.98, Einstein's predicted value<span id = line_2782> [2782] </span>
<br>
being 1''.75. Further, for these plates the agreement was all that<span id = line_2783> [2783] </span>
<br>
could be expected....<span id = line_2784> [2784] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2785> [2785] </span>
<br>
After a careful study of the plates I am prepared to say that there<span id = line_2786> [2786] </span>
<br>
can be no doubt that they confirm Einstein's prediction. A very<span id = line_2787> [2787] </span>
<br>
definite result has been obtained that light is deflected according<span id = line_2788> [2788] </span>
<br>
to Einstein's law of gravitation.<span id = line_2789> [2789] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2790> [2790] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2791> [2791] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2792> [2792] </span>
<br>

<br>
Professor A. S. Eddington<span id = line_2794> [2794] </span>

<br>
Mr. Cottingham and I left the other observers at Madeira and arrived<span id = line_2797> [2797] </span>
<br>
at Principe on April 23.... We soon realized that the prospect of<span id = line_2798> [2798] </span>
<br>
a clear sky at the end of May was not very good. Not even a heavy<span id = line_2799> [2799] </span>
<br>
thunderstorm on the morning of the eclipse, three weeks after the end<span id = line_2800> [2800] </span>
<br>
of the wet season, saved the situation. The sky was completely cloudy<span id = line_2801> [2801] </span>
<br>
at first contact, but about half an hour before totality we began to<span id = line_2802> [2802] </span>
<br>
see glimpses of the sun's crescent through the clouds. We carried<span id = line_2803> [2803] </span>
<br>
out our program exactly as arranged, and the sky must have been<span id = line_2804> [2804] </span>
<br>
clearer towards the end of totality. Of the 16 plates taken during<span id = line_2805> [2805] </span>
<br>
the five minutes of totality the first ten showed no stars at all;<span id = line_2806> [2806] </span>
<br>
of the later plates two showed five stars each, from which a result<span id = line_2807> [2807] </span>
<br>
could be obtained. Comparing them with the check-plates secured at<span id = line_2808> [2808] </span>
<br>
Oxford before we went out, we obtained as the final result from the<span id = line_2809> [2809] </span>
<br>
two plates for the value of the displacement of the limb 1''.6 ±<span id = line_2810> [2810] </span>
<br>
0.3.... This result supports the figures obtained at Sobral....<span id = line_2811> [2811] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2812> [2812] </span>
<br>
I will pass now to a few words on the meaning of the result. It points<span id = line_2813> [2813] </span>
<br>
to the larger of the two possible values of the deflection. The<span id = line_2814> [2814] </span>
<br>
simplest interpretation of the bending of the ray is to consider<span id = line_2815> [2815] </span>
<br>
it as an effect of the weight of light. We know that momentum is<span id = line_2816> [2816] </span>
<br>
carried along on the path of a beam of light. Gravity in acting<span id = line_2817> [2817] </span>
<br>
creates momentum in a direction different from that of the path of<span id = line_2818> [2818] </span>
<br>
the ray and so causes it to bend. For the half-effect we have to<span id = line_2819> [2819] </span>
<br>
assume that gravity obeys Newton's law; for the full effect which has<span id = line_2820> [2820] </span>
<br>
been obtained we must assume that gravity obeys the new law proposed<span id = line_2821> [2821] </span>
<br>
by Einstein. This is one of the most crucial tests between Newton's<span id = line_2822> [2822] </span>
<br>
law and the proposed new law. Einstein's law had already indicated a<span id = line_2823> [2823] </span>
<br>
perturbation, causing the orbit of Mercury to revolve. That confirms<span id = line_2824> [2824] </span>
<br>
it for relatively small velocities. Going to the limit, where the<span id = line_2825> [2825] </span>
<br>
speed is that of light, the perturbation is increased in such a way<span id = line_2826> [2826] </span>
<br>
as to double the curvature of the path, and this is now confirmed.<span id = line_2827> [2827] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2828> [2828] </span>
<br>
This effect may be taken as proving Einstein's law rather than his<span id = line_2829> [2829] </span>
<br>
theory. It is not affected by the failure to detect the displacement<span id = line_2830> [2830] </span>
<br>
of Fraunhofer lines on the sun. If this latter failure is confirmed<span id = line_2831> [2831] </span>
<br>
it will not affect Einstein's law of gravitation, but it will affect<span id = line_2832> [2832] </span>
<br>
the views on which the law was arrived at. The law is right, though<span id = line_2833> [2833] </span>
<br>
the fundamental ideas underlying it may yet be questioned....<span id = line_2834> [2834] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2835> [2835] </span>
<br>
One further point must be touched upon. Are we to attribute the<span id = line_2836> [2836] </span>
<br>
displacement to the gravitational field and not to the refracting<span id = line_2837> [2837] </span>
<br>
matter around the sun? The refractive index required to produce the<span id = line_2838> [2838] </span>
<br>
result at a distance of 15' from the sun would be that given by gases<span id = line_2839> [2839] </span>
<br>
at a pressure of 1/60 to 1/200 of an atmosphere. This is of too great<span id = line_2840> [2840] </span>
<br>
a density considering the depth through which the light would have<span id = line_2841> [2841] </span>
<br>
to pass.<span id = line_2842> [2842] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2843> [2843] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2844> [2844] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2845> [2845] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2846> [2846] </span>
<br>
Sir J. J. Thomson<span id = line_2847> [2847] </span>
<br>
President of the Royal Society<span id = line_2848> [2848] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2849> [2849] </span>
<br>
... If the results obtained had been only that light was affected by<span id = line_2850> [2850] </span>
<br>
gravitation, it would have been of the greatest importance. Newton,<span id = line_2851> [2851] </span>
<br>
did, in fact, suggest this very point in his "Optics," and his<span id = line_2852> [2852] </span>
<br>
suggestion would presumably have led to the half-value. But this result<span id = line_2853> [2853] </span>
<br>
is not an isolated one; it is part of a whole continent of scientific<span id = line_2854> [2854] </span>
<br>
ideas affecting the most fundamental concepts of physics.... This is<span id = line_2855> [2855] </span>
<br>
the most important result obtained in connection with the theory of<span id = line_2856> [2856] </span>
<br>
gravitation since Newton's day, and it is fitting that it should be<span id = line_2857> [2857] </span>
<br>
announced at a meeting of the society so closely connected with him.<span id = line_2858> [2858] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2859> [2859] </span>
<br>
The difference between the laws of gravitation of Einstein and Newton<span id = line_2860> [2860] </span>
<br>
come only in special cases. The real interest of Einstein's theory<span id = line_2861> [2861] </span>
<br>
lies not so much in his results as in the method by which he gets<span id = line_2862> [2862] </span>
<br>
them. If his theory is right, it makes us take an entirely new view<span id = line_2863> [2863] </span>
<br>
of gravitation. If it is sustained that Einstein's reasoning holds<span id = line_2864> [2864] </span>
<br>
good--and it has survived two very severe tests in connection with the<span id = line_2865> [2865] </span>
<br>
perihelion of mercury and the present eclipse--then it is the result<span id = line_2866> [2866] </span>
<br>
of one of the highest achievements of human thought. The weak point<span id = line_2867> [2867] </span>
<br>
in the theory is the great difficulty in expressing it. It would<span id = line_2868> [2868] </span>
<br>
seem that no one can understand the new law of gravitation without<span id = line_2869> [2869] </span>
<br>
a thorough knowledge of the theory of invariants and of the calculus<span id = line_2870> [2870] </span>
<br>
of variations.<span id = line_2871> [2871] </span>
<br>
<span id = line_2872> [2872] </span>
<br>
One other point of physical interest arises from the discussion. Light<span id = line_2873> [2873] </span>
<br>
is deflected in passing near huge bodies of matter. This involves<span id = line_2874> [2874] </span>
<br>
alterations in the electric and magnetic field. This, again, implies<span id = line_2875> [2875] </span>
<br>
the existence of electric and magnetic forces outside matter--forces<span id = line_2876> [2876] </span>
<br>
at present unknown, though some idea of their nature may be got from<span id = line_2877> [2877] </span>
