<html><body>I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm [1]
<br>
increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash [2]
<br>
over my head.  It was echoed from Saleve, the Juras, and the Alps of [3]
<br>
Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the [4]
<br>
lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant [5]
<br>
every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself [6]
<br>
from the preceding flash.  The storm, as is often the case in [7]
<br>
Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens.  The [8]
<br>
most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the [9]
<br>
lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of [10]
<br>
Copet.  Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another [11]
<br>
darkened and sometimes disclosed the Mole, a peaked mountain to the [12]
<br>
east of the lake. [13]</body></html>
